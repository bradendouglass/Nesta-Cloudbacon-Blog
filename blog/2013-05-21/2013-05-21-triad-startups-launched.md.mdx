For a couple of monthsâ€¦ err maybe longer, I have been working, slowly on the launch of [Triad Startups][1]. Sir, well I am not entirely sure if he is officially knighted, [David Horne][2] and myself have been attempting to "co-join" all startups hanging out in the [Triad region of NC][3]. And we have [done it][1]!

At the moment there isn't too much going on over there. However, if you are a local and/or would like to stay in the know, [sign up for the newsletter][1]. We will be sending out a handcrafted email every month that will inform and excite you about everything "start-uppery" going on in our Triad. If you have some skills that you want to share and you would like to pitch in a helping hand with design/development we would completely [enjoy it][5].

For all the haters out there, sipping on all their haterade, [fuck yeah][4]. I __can__ launch something.
