Convention VS Configuration is a big deal in the Rails Community. So large in fact,
some might say it dictates the entirety of the [framework][1].
This is a classic example of what the term "Convention VS Configuration" or
"Convention over Configuration" stands for:

I am always up for a good bit of trolling but, this "Coderwall" seems to really
be behind the statement (goes on to explain what the command is doing). Why not
just use [fish][3]?

As a quick aside, anyone who uses the term '[poodling][4]' on their 'resume' is ok
in my book!
