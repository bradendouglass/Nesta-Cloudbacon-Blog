Many fine [Rails Devs][1] lean on [Pow][2] to locally "host" their apps
in dev mode. Up until a few days ago, I really didn't use Pow very much.
However, in a fit of boredom, I decided to see what it could do. The
answer? [Crash][5].

There appears to be a really odd issue in Pow (maybe due to its lax
dev schedule) that affects us [Tmux][3] evangelists. If you initiate the
install script while in a session, the install fails miserably. Just
pop out, reinstall, and [boom][4], all is well in your Rail's life.

As an aside, I really hope that 37 Signals doesn't abandon the project
because there really has been little work on it as of late. Then again,
maybe it is so well made it doesn't need any "real" maintance.

Oh, and Happy [Whiskey][6] - [Journey][7] Friday!
