A few weeks ago something so terrible, so...unbelievably...terrible happened to my beloved Ifone: It [fell][1]. Specifically, it fell out of my ridiculous [brace][2] and onto pavement. Upon inspection, I realized that my foolhardy [meneuver][3] had cost me a refurb iPhone. Had I had the [brainz][4] to have purchased one of [these][5], everything would be unliterraly "smashing" at the moment. Man, I love how the popularity of the iPhone continues to allow shitty ideas to prosper.
