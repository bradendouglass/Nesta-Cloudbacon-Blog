Yeah, why the fuck [not][1]? How have we gotten to the point where we
simply accept [shitty software][2] (although I hear number 10 is way
[good][3])? Do you get all giddy when you sit down in the morning and
turn on Outlook and Office? I happen to work with several of [these
peoples][4] and all I hear [spew from their mouths][5] each morning are
[groans][6](I swear it is sorta a true story).

Yeah...well, again, why the _fuck_ do people ship anything but happiness?
Is it hard, sure but, why on earth would you go through the trouble for a
few quick bucks? And, guarenteed it will be a measly few. People usually
don't contine to buy shitty software if it continues to exude shit...
Wait, no that's not right.

Look at [Microsoft][7] and basically everything they make. It is defined
by how much hapiness it [sucks from people][8] and yet people continue
to [use this shit][9] without question. How do we fix this? Just fucking
stop building shitty things and pump the market with a [fuck-ton][10] of
happiness. Because, really? What else is needed?

I apologize for the lack of love in these posts lately. I need to
stretch their formation out over the day (VS when I get home from it) and hope it solves this
issue. No guarentees promised, pre-haps a little bit of alcohol is all
that is needed.
