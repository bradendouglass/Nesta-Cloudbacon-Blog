title: Believe in Your Product

Starting a blog post with a story or a list is automatic [link love][1]
from the [Googs][2]...I think.

###A Story

I happen to work for a really wonderful company that makes a good amount
of its profits from public transport. [Planes, trains, buses][3], you name
it. Just not [automobiles][4]. If you were to work at a place like this
and take pride in your product, you would likely ride the bus. Studying
every move people make, what defines their buying decisions. Moreover, even down
to what type of music they listen to as their public transport trudges
on...[consuming more of their day than their feedumb cars][5].

Your participation / [devotion][6] would lead you to purchasing the
product that you produced and believing the fact that someday, just
maybe, you could sell your car in favor of supporting the people that
make your life possible. I work to support public transport, and these
feelings [wash over me][7] on a daily basis.

###The Deal

If you produce a product and you can't stand behind it by actually using
it, you have [no business being in business][8]. What you are really in
it for is the money, and as we can see in our current economy, this
method doesn't lead to sustainability. Today is Friday...I think. Take
the weekend to look over your current product and how you feel about it.
Are you passionate? If not, take Monday and Tuesday of next week to
reflect on the whole ordeal. If things look bleak by Wednesday, quit.

Suriosly.

Also this post was finished so close to the deadline that it was
finished without much editing. [YUP][9]!
