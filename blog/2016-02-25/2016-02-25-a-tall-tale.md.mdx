I wrote a Post! Although not on this blrg. 
Nope, instead Tumblr wooed me over to the dark side and without know where I was or how I had gotten there, 
a post had spawned from nowhere. 
The topic? Remote stuff, mainly work and with a slight twist which includes a hobbit. 
Get over there and read it when you find some time. Seriously though. It's that good.
