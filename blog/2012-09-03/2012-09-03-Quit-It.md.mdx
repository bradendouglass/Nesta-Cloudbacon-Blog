If you agree with [this post][1] we have a problem. Srsly, like dialing
[Houston][2] at this-very-moment [problem][3]. If saying goodbye to
employment with a company that you don't own is the scariest thing you
can think of... I don't know, go think of these [ants][4]. They are
about 1 million times more scary than quiting a job.

Oh, and feel free to [not download these plugins][5]. Also, how about
the scariest thing you could think of is getting traffic tanked by
Hacker News? It is 9-est on Monday ([Labour][6] day) and there is 0
access.
