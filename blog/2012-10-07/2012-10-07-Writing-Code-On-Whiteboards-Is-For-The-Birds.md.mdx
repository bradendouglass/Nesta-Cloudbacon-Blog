This should come to no surprise to anyone: I love searching for jobs.
When you have been fired as many times as I have from yobs, you learn to
enjoy the process that is involved in nailing one down. Yes, this makes
me perfect for the freelance role; however, I have yet to find a way to
break into that club.

Anyway, I spent this Friday in a "[surprise interview][1]" and nailed
every last section besides...yep, you guessed it: the technical section.
It isn't that I freeze or can't answer their questions, it is the simple
fact that writing code on a whiteboard is the least functional way to
figure out what someone knows. The equivalent is [this][2]. And,
personally, my hips aren't that mobile.

One of the best techincal interviews I ever had the grace to be apart of
was with [Harvest][3]. It was all over the phone, no code writing on a
fucking whiteboard, and 100% of it relevant to what occurs while working
with a "[brown field app][4]". If you are a hiring manger, please think
carefully about your technical questions and __DON'T__ make the
participant scribble their answer on a board.

_Update_: [This blog post][5] nicely defines some of the more "technical"
reasons behind why programming on whiteboards makes little sense.
