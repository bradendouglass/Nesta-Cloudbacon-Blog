title: NVM without Xcode
layout: post
---

Since you are a kick-ass developer, you own a Macbook Air (most of us
do) yet, you are constantly pressed
for moah hard drive space. With Xcode being a bit "[portly][1]", "there has
got to be a better way"...to do stuff. The kick-ass peeps at
[Thoughtbot][2] have a wonderful [post][3] walking someone through
setting up a sweet Ruby dev environment on a brand new, Mountain Lion
powered Mac.

Once that is done, send some sweet traffic to this [post][4]. It
walks through some needed tweaks when running the [homebrew-dupes][5] version
of gcc. Finally, run this command in your favorite shell to tell NVM
(and other "items of importance") where your Xcode installation
"resides":

`sudo xcode-select -switch /usr/local/bin`

Now when you run `nvm install v.0.x.x` it won't fail because you feel
Xcode is a bloated pig and it doesn't deserve your hard drive's
time-of-day. In addition, you have a lean, mean way to build some really
cool shit with two awesome languages.
