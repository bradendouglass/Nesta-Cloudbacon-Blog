Yep, so wait. What is [Markup][1]? Well if you happen to follow the
links on this blog (and you really are safer if you don't), Wikipedia
catagorizes...or lists it into 3 distinct groups:

1. __Presentational Markup__: Which happens to be the [XML][2]-y type
   stuff that [Word][2] and other word processors use. In addition, this
   style of markup is seldomly seen by the end user.
1. __Procedural Markup__: What we will be focusing on. This style of
   markup IS seen by the user and is [sprinkled][3](be ware the Wizard) throughout the text.
   A preprocessor comes along, reads the text and hands the styled text
   back to the user.
1. __Descriptive Markup__: This form is sprinkled throughout the text,
   much like the Procedural form; however, it has no bearing on a
   [preprocessor][4]. A good example of this is the hashtag(#tag) syntax
   that [some of us][5] use on <strike>Twitter</strike> AppDotNet to
   catagorize our updates.

Yes, until [Dalton][12] comes to his senses and realizes that he has a cool
project with a dumb name, [it][6] will be written that way.

What we are talking about here is a light language (sometimes called "[DSLs][7]")
that is used to express oneself beyond text. Anyone not see the beauty
in that? The user gets a [free ride][8] by using text documents that are
generated with style, flare and that never expire (text documents [wont
be going out of style anytime soon][9]).

Many of us, myself included have flocked to the [lovable][10]
[Markdown][11]. Originally it was used to style documents for web
viewing; however, now it has bleed into many text editors, iPhone and
Android editors, and it is still fairly prevalent when it comes to web
based writing. I have become so accustomed to the syntax, and
incorporated its usage into so many applications that my brain now
thinks on Markdown.

What Markup language do you think in?
