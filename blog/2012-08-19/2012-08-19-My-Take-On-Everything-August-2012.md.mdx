[Genuis][1]! This post will be a rundown of all of the recent [tech-shit][2]
that has been [dominating][3] the news for the past month. Most of the
items that will be [listed][4](I know, most people despise them), will be
subjects that aren't worth an entire post. Without further [ado][5], lets
get this rollin'.

###App.net

I have refrained from talking about [Dalton][6] and the [ridiculously][7]
named "App.net" due to my "unnease" with the whole project. I am a huge
fan of Twitter yet, not what they are pulling at [the moment][8] with their
developers. After listening to a [few podcasts][9] on the subject, the
fact that you can export all of your "updates" in plain-text is really
interesting. I could [give two shits about][10] moah characters (200 something),
lack of third party application support, or being the hip thing to do.
If App.net can deliver, I will throw my 50 dollars at them per year. It
may be a steap price but, it is worth it for the peace of mind

###MS Surface

For the people who [don't know][11] (which is probably a good amount of
you). The keyboard is dumb, the prie point is unknown and it will run
[Metro][16]...OOPs, probably going to get sued for that. Microsoft needs to
stick to what [they do best][12] and forget about following
[trends][13].

###Facebook Stock

Really? Who bought [this stuff][14]? Let it tank, and let the people who
thought they were buying into Google in 1998 go with it.

###Apple VS Samsung

Anyone in their right mind knows to give the [whole patent][15] thing 0
percent of their time.

###Fin

Thanks for all the fish!
