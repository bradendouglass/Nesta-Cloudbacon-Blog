When you start a project of any kind do you start by typing something
into a [terminal][2] or do you begin on a [piece of paper][1]? Many
developers probably start by typing some stuff out but rarely, perhaps
like our [designer brethren][3], do we begin with [analog tools][4].
Why? Is it because developers feel more at home with a bunch of
[chicklet keys][5] or do we generally have no use for sketching
features out?

There is definitely a place for a great [pen][6] and piece of [paper][7] in the
beginning and subsequent phases of software dev. Perhaps not to sketch
things out logically but, to [chaotically][8] write features everywhere. Jot
down table names, feature ideas, needed gems, future plans, whatever.
The only rule being, never stay within the lines!

Find a [notebook][9] that is layed out in a dot-grid or a traditional
line grid. This alone absolves the need to write everything down on a
line starting from the left and moving to the right. You can start
anywhere, and go anywhere which leaves your brain free to jot down
anything and add to it later. This type of [freedom][10] is much more
constrained when it comes to interacting with text using just a keyboard
and mouse (yes, I am making an assumption that you don't have a fancy
Cintiq).

The ability to be chaotic is priceless and something that should be
cultivated during the entire [life-cycle][11] of any "software project".
If you have never thought about grabbing a piece of paper and writing
out things, give it a whirl. If you happen to be [allergic to
paper][12]...well, then maybe take this advice with a grain of salt.
