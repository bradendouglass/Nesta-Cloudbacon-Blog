__TWO__ posts in one day!!! Anyway, not really. No need to get your
hopes up so high you shit yourself. Nah, this is just a quick blurb
about some cool things you can do with the [leader key][1].

1. Run some tests
1. Switch to a Rails controller, view, or model
1. Search through a list of files
1. Search through a list of buffers
1. Open a command to be piped to a specific tmux window
1. Open a visual tree-list of all files in the current director
1. Turn a line into a comment
1. Switch the case of an entire word
1. Show a list of ctags
1. Do git legwork

...and so much more. Yeah, Leader is pretty much my power animal.
