OH yes sir(and/or/maybe mam), it is completely doable. Since the [dawn of
the programmer][1], we have been portrayed as fairly [portly][2] dweebs
who exist in a [chronic sitting position][3]. While this has been true
in the past, and surely is at the [moment][4] (who the fuck would even purchase a diabetic calendar - tres bizarre), we can do a lot to help
ourselves stay healthy while still doing what we [absolutely love][5].

[Change is hard][6](it really is sad about Lenovo moving to chicklet stylz), especially when it comes to the food we shove in our
[pie-holes][7]. However, programmers are accustom to change. They pivot
constantly, change their working environments and generally don't have a
problem with this...right? Keeping this easy then, let's just stop
eating carbohydates and sugar. Pretty easy huh?

No carbs and no sugars means no [spaghetti][8], pasta, bread, muffins,
cakes, any of it. To make this transition easy, follow this rule six out
of seven days in the week (one day off). Ok, so why right? Well sugar
and carbs force your pancreas to [produce a lot of insulin][9] which
will inevitably lead to diabetes and weight gain. Both of these things,
if you are lost, are bad.

And that's it? Yep! Well...actually, give a [standing desk][10] a whirl.
They can be hard to get used to; however, are great for your posture,
back strength, legs, etc in the long run. If you are worried about
standing all day (it is hard at first) find one that auto-magically
moves up and down. They are expensive but will add years onto the
backend of your life in order for you to continue to do what you love
well into your old age. Go [forth][11] and be a healthy, kick-ass
programmer!
