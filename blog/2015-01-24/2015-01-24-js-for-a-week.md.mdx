# JS For A Week

For the better part of 5 years I have been writing,
hacking and generally focused on the Ruby programming language.
This hasnâ€™t stopped me from exploring other languages; however,
besides a small and rather painful stint writing PHP (again),
many days were spent crafting Ruby code.
In addition to this,
the last 2 years has been spent ping-ponging between different code bases.
Not so much over the course of the past week.
Yep, all of it was spent writing purely Javascript and without the help of Coffee
and all for a single product.

## What was learned

The best thing to do after a dicotomy of a situation like this
is to perform a bit of introspection

## Why it was hard
## Why it differs so greatly from Ruby
## What was the takeway
