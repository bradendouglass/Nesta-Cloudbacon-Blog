![Merlin Mann's Epic Mug][1]

[Merlin Mann][2] is an absolute fucking
force to be reckoned with. Not only is he, in my mind, one of the single most
smart-assery people in the field of productivity, he is a genius with his
[humor][3]. He recently got together
with the wonderful team behind
[Mac Power Users Podcast][4] and produced an epic (2 1/2 hours) tome of meandering,
shiny ramblings. This recording is a gem for anyone who is looking to be more
efficient with their time, write like a crack addict, or just wants to learn
something new.
