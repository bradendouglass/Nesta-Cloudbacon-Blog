Do you happen to listen to these things called [smodcasts][1]? If you don't,
than there is a good chance you missed [this episode of the Web Ahead][2].
[Andy Clark][3] had a solid rant concerning the Old VS New guard of the web.
Another person who feels relatively passionate towards this subject would be
[Drew Wilson][4] who puts on [Valio Con][5], which aims at bringing "young guns"
into the speaking spotlight.

Does anyone remember when Coda and Textmate were new on the scene? When I see
people continuing to use these tools I make a concoious effort to interrupt their
[workflow][7] and ask them what they are working on in [Coffeescript][6]? Or
better yet: how they enjoy Compass? Sure this could be construed as a "dick"
approach however, you learn a lot about people while being said: dick. In 99%
of these mentioned interactions I am gifted with a face that expresses both
confusion and an utter sense of [discomfort][8].

If you were to prod deeper into what these "Web Professionals" do, you realize
that whatever it is, it has no outside influence. They don't spend Saturdays
flipping through specs or reading other people's code on Github. Rather, they
go to work and do the same thing they did yesterday; only changing when a client
shows or better yet, demmands something new. This reactive form of learning
is what separrates the Old from the New.

An example: [Smashing Magazine wrote a recent article][9] about how to do just
this: "stay up to date."

If you as a "Web Professional" think it is hard, than
yes, it is. Why? Well, the fact is that you have been resting on HTML and jQuery
for too damn long. It is time to wake the fuck up, smell the Coffeescript and
learn all the cool things that 'the kids are doing.' Why? The simple answer is
that you have already coded yourself out of a job. If you want to keep learning,
that job will likely still be there. However, if you continue to be a curmudgeon
about the whole subject, than you just might be... Properly Fucked.

With all good posts, this shall end with an epic list. The list will be broken
up by headlines describing the following projects. Find one that looks cool and
