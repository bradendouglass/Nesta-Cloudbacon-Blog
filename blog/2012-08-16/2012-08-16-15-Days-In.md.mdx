Yes-sir-ree-bob (I think that is how it is spelled) is the
coveted, and prehaps much unanticipated [mid-way-30-day][2] challenge update.
Avoiding much [hoopla][3], let's get somewhat started.

To say that the experience hasn't been [hard][4], would be fairly
difficult. Depending who you are as an individual, you could easily find
30 minutes a day to bang out a somewhat short blog post. The hard part
mentioned is making them [coherent][5], funny, somewhat well-written and
[digestable][6]. The real rub comes in the creation of the content
though.

Being able to [rifle][7] out a few posts after a single brain storming
session is far from difficult. Being able to consistently create content
day after day is. If you don't open Vim (you [ARE using vim][8] right?)
at the beginning of the day, then you are destined to waste a good
amount of time at night [floundering][10] through an otherwise shitty post.
This coupled with the above brain storming issue make __actually__
writing a post every day, somewhat difficult. Not impossible though.

Having a plan for capturing post ideas on the fly (I utilize Omnifocus heavily for this task) and
starting the writing early on will make the overall experience 100.times better.
On the [whole][9], the experience has been a combination of agony,
happiness, bouts of uncontrollable smiling, and lots of equal (=) signs.
Yep, that good.
