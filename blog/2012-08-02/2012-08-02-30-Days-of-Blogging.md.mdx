THROWDOWN! What the fuck am I thinking with all of this? Anyway some of the
readers might have seen a [influx][1] of posts in their feed with this blog
over the past couple of days. What is happening is a blog posting will be
performed each and every day for 30 whole days or 26 [metric days][3] (whichever way you swing).
I am sure I have tried this before but, I always seem to fall short on the 9th day.
Well folks, this time it is going to be different.

<strike>Mission</strike> no, wait <strike>delegation</strike>...hmm.
Operation. No that's all wrong.

Anyway, the idea will be to generate some sort of useful tidbit, hack,
Ruby code, workflow, piece of awesome, or something every day until
September 1st. All of the wacky linking will be provided free of charge. So make damn sure to
click as many links as possible in a futile attempt to figure out what
is going on in my rat trap of a brain.

The prize for all of this you might ask? [A Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2][2].
Yes, I have been looking at picking one up for a long time and need a
chellenge of this proportion to offset the cost of that sexy, sexy
keyboard. Until tomorrow...also some general rules are below!
