#About The Author

[Yello][16], my name is Braden Douglass! If for some reason you are here because you
don't care about me, I suggest you either [check out some articles][9] or go
[here][10].

I spent a good amount of my life growing up in the bitter North, in a state that
many people, to this day, think is part of Canada: Maine. From there, I began my
migration South/West which left me at a small Quaker institution for College
where I accumulated a bunch of knowledge about Computer Science, Political Science
and Theology. Afterwards, I wandered from Virginia to Wyoming, found a wife, and
[landed on Florida][11] in 2009.

I found myself bored with technology and decided to take up Ruby/Rails along with
programming for the web. As an aside, I actually began an on-again-off-again
relationship with programming when I was 16 with Python and table based HTML.
In the past 7 years I have found and grown my passion
for crafting code. Now, I create things using a combination of
Ruby/Rails/Javascript/HTML/Vim but, this is always in flux. 

Currently I am working for a wonderful beauty company named: [Glossier][17]. 
Below you will find a plethora of methods to get in contact with me. Please do.
