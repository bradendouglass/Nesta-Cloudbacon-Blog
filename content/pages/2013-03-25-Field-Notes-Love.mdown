Title: New Notes
Date: March 25, 2013
Summary: or a new problem?

Ok, so I thought I wrote something about my current paper/digital notes workflow 
but, damned if I can find it. So let this be it! Anywho, I have been bitten by 
the [FieldNotes][1] bug. These have replaced all paper notebooks and driven most 
of my "programmer notes" where they belong: on a [wiki][4]. [Here are a few of my new 
editions][2] that I recently found. This might become [a problem][3] / does anyone 
have a sealed or unsealed [Northerly Version][5] they want to get rid of?
