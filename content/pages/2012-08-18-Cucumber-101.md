Title: Cucumber 101
Date: August 18, 2012
Summary: ...pilot

I know it is pretty fucking cliched; however, it is hard to go through a
[Ruby day][1] without some [surious][2] testing. That's right, if you
don't know what "TATFT" means than you haven't been doing [craftsmen][3]
level software development for all that long. In this post we are going
to take a newly formed [[Rails]] application and get it up to speed with
some simple [Cucumber][4] style tests. In addition, this will be my
first software based post, which is kind of exciting...I think.

The first thing that needs to be done is cracking open that [Gemfile][5]
and let's add in these lines:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'cucumber-rails', :require => false
  gem 'capybara-webkit'
  gem 'database_cleaner'
end
```

If you are one of [those people][6] who feel the need to place version
numbers in your Gemfile, go ahead. As an aside, I recommend NOT doing
this. Use your Gemfile.lock and your version control [du jour][7] to
keep gem versions inline with your dev and production platforms.

The three gems you added into your Rails application are as follows:

1. [[Cucumber-rails]] adds all the requires into your app where needed. A
   `rails g cucumber:install` will also need to be run after bundle
   installing the above gems.
1. Database cleaner will cleanse your test environment after each test.
1. Capybara-webkit is a handy gem for running `@javascript` tagged tests
   in a [headless environment][8]. It does require you download/compile
   QT-Webkit; however, this is a breeze with Homebrew (it is listed as
   'qt')
 
Once you finnish installing QT (Tested on 10.8.0 @2012.08.18 and working
great) you should head over to `/railsAppRoot/features/support/env.rb` and add in this
string:

```ruby
Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
```

And VOILA! You are ready to start testing! For a handy way to run
commands/tests, using [command line][9] Vim and Tmux, read [this post][10]
by someone way smarter than myself. Keep your eyes peeled for another
post on Cucumber stories and how to write reusable yet sensible tests in
your Rails app.
