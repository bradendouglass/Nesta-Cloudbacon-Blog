Title: Rails Custom Code
Date: March 7, 2013
Summary: Oh how it differs


It happens to be Thursday which, unbeknownst to me, is [highly speculative][1]. In addition, I received some feedback on "something" this week that made me chuckle. Being a fairly normal developer, the moment chuckling gets in the mix, I head strait to Github for a venting session. Feel free to [take these two files of code][2] for example.

The [first controller][3] in the gist is something that I wrote from the ground up. Every instance variable, hand crafted and exuding an amount of [love and care][4] that is frankly, so fucking "pornograpic" in nature you might get fired if you glance upon it.

The [second controller][5] is an absolute pile of generated trash. That's right! Rails and its' handy dandy generators made that one and talk about [code smells][1]. Phew, that shits worse than [Whales][6], which is apparently a [shithole][7], akin only to Jersey.

For all new, old, aspiring, and even pining Rubyists out there: You suck unless you ashew provided tools and waste your time creating a simple but, "custom" controller. Yep, be "custom" over being effective.

You are welcome.
