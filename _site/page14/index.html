    <p>Yes-sir-ree-bob (I think that is how it is <a href="http://www.raymondcostello.com/assets/images/autogen/a_Ray-_-Bob-Villa.jpg">spelled</a>) is the
coveted, and prehaps much unanticipated <a href="http://robbwolf.com/">mid-way-30-day</a> challenge update.
Avoiding much <a href="http://hooplawine.com/home">hoopla</a>, let’s get somewhat started.</p>

<p>To say that the experience hasn’t been <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">hard</a>, would be fairly
difficult. Depending who you are as an individual, you could easily find
30 minutes a day to bang out a somewhat short blog post. The hard part
mentioned is making them <a href="https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large">coherent</a>, funny, somewhat well-written and
<a href="https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large">digestable</a>. The real rub comes in the creation of the content
though.</p>

<p>Being able to <a href="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi">rifle</a> out a few posts after a single brain storming
session is far from difficult. Being able to consistently create content
day after day is. If you don’t open Vim (you <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=Vim+site%3Acloudbacon.com">ARE using vim</a> right?)
at the beginning of the day, then you are destined to waste a good
amount of time at night <a href="http://imgur.com/FHWMO">floundering</a> through an otherwise shitty post.
This coupled with the above brain storming issue make <strong>actually</strong>
writing a post every day, somewhat difficult. Not impossible though.</p>

<p>Having a plan for capturing post ideas on the fly (I utilize Omnifocus heavily for this task) and
starting the writing early on will make the overall experience 100.times better.
On the <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">whole</a>, the experience has been a combination of agony,
happiness, bouts of uncontrollable smiling, and lots of equal (=) signs.
Yep, that good.</p>

      <a href="//2012/08/15/iCloudyness-VS-Dropping-Things/">
        iCloud VS Dropbox
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>I am well aware that there was a promise made to deliver on a half-way
point post about this whole 30 day challenge. However, this isn’t it. So
quit your <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/187710">bitchin</a>.</p>

<p>There have been a few posts lately (mostly on those blogs that rake in
the real <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">dough</a>) highlighting people’s usage of <a href="http://db.tt/2xQgdve">Dropbox</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Me">iCloud</a>.
Both are great ways to sync data across <a href="http://cdn.crackberry.com/files/kevin/storm2/blackberrystorm2overview.jpg">multiple devices</a> and both
seem to be “<a href="http://blog.lenovo.com/images/uploads/hero/TopView_T430s_crop.jpg">manageable</a>” when staying within their <a href="http://imgur.com/FHWMO">free domain</a>.
So they’re tools, free, and do the same thing; what makes them
different?</p>

<p>For starters, Dropbox is <a href="https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large">rooted</a> in the old-timey idea of a file
system. You, the user create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Week">obnoxiously deep</a> folder structures to house
files you don’t really care about because the likely-hood of you
retrieving them through memory is slim at best. iCloud on the
<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Your%20other%20right&amp;defid=4815784">other hand</a> pulls all that shit away from the user and makes
syncing app related. This means that apps keep track of the files, not
some weird folder grouping.</p>

<p>Before I go into how I use iCloud (because frankly I use Dropbox like
everyone else: it is a cluster of folders that contain items I only
find on <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">accident</a>), I want you, the reader to understand that I am
very opinionated….k, thx.</p>

<p>Why use both? iCloud and its app specific file syncing makes it great
for keeping loose amounts of stuff around. Particuarly stuff from <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day
One</a> or any app that you might care little about. You can just chuck
shit in, and not worry about the way files are handled. This freedom
allows the writer to create without ever worrying if he/she will find it
again. I find it liberating. This idea of a
<a href="http://yfiles.tumblr.com/post/28095580833/20-hours-with-mountain-lion">flat file system</a> is pretty fucking Genius, and I am rather
interested to see where Apple is going with it.</p>

<p>Something awesome: RiserFS / BTRFS mixed with a flat system + git.
Fucking epic!</p>

    <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Uh, I know, another post on some kind of <a href="http://rlv.zcache.com/obey_sudo_card-p137691123849347174bh2r3_400.jpg">sudo</a>(see what I did there) <a href="https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large">productivity</a> ideal.
Don’t <a href="http://www.pakalertpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/8-suspicious-events-surrounding-the-Miami-zombie-attack.jpg">fret</a> too much, you have 15 or so more days left of it.
Moreover, you can very well bet your <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/96193234/britches">britches</a> that there will be
some kind of a <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502a845aaac422e922000005/big">“half-way point”</a> toot tomorrow instead of anything
remotely resembling nerdtastic.</p>

<p>Right! <a href="http://frictionless.bigcartel.com/product/capture-cards">Note Cards</a>! Or “Capture Cards”, as us <strike>un</strike>productive fools like
to call them, are great for grabbing all the little things that come
<a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">flying by</a>. Those items that <a href="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi">bombard us</a> so quickly that we
don’t have enough time to pull out our <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">iDevice</a> but, we need to jot
them down due to their <a href="http://productivity.stackexchange.com/questions/1236/how-to-discern-between-actionable-items-and-someday-maybe">action-ability</a>. There are two really great
aspects that make note cards indispensible in this manner:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They are <a href="http://www.javaranch.com/journal/2003/04/immutable.htm">mutable</a> objects… Meaning they are easily discarded
and replaced. This simplicity allows them to be easily found, even if
you show up empty handed.</li>
  <li>They are non-threatening. When people pull out their phones they
threaten the crowd with the fact that they (the crowd) are so boring
that you need to “check-in”.</li>
  <li>You didn’t think that you would get through a post on productivity
without some kind of list did you? Good. Because that is actually impossible.</li>
  <li>Number 4…ok, done.</li>
</ol>

<p>What tools are required for all this malarkey?</p>

    <p>There comes a time in <a href="http://www.nextnature.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tilapia-swimming-in-tank-530x397.jpg">everyone’s lives</a>, hopefully when they are
young, that they realize <a href="http://youtu.be/T5ictPToU9M">something is wrong</a>. We all go through it
no matter who you are. <a href="http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/toddlers-tiaras">Young</a>, <a href="http://reidreport.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/murdoch.jpg">old</a>, <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2006-02-12/politics/cheney_1_katharine-armstrong-birdshot-saturday-afternoon-armstrong-ranch?_s=PM:POLITICS">wealthy</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_and_Poors">dirt poor</a>.
We all go through a time of reflection that makes us question why and
what we are doing…well, except some of us.</p>

<p>Most people are petrified to question their life choices; however, they do
so because they quickly realize that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_American_entertainers">everyone else has done it</a>.
In addition, I used to be a punk rock fan so I understand about the whole “following
people thing”…and yes there are some times when it is warranted. Some
people call it the <a href="http://undercurrentcoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/glory-years.jpg">quarter life crisis</a>; however, it is just some
time in your twenties/early thirties where you “<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FfZMBBaCF8w/SJdo-hpFfkI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/WD7et8UdAI4/s400/create.jpg">begin to be</a>”.</p>

<p>Some of us go through it for longer periods than others and that is ok.
The biggest part being that it occurs. What I have witnessed lately is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time">metric fuck-ton</a> of mid-20 year olds in such a <a href="http://voices.yahoo.com/todays-youth-generation-blue-ribbon-winners-148076.html">coddled state</a>
that they completely miss out. Besides raising a bunch of
softy-philosophers (I have no beef with hard ass philosophers), we are
stuck with a group of people who believe…like for fucking real, this
statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>all his life he was told that he wanted in life would come to him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Feel free to sub out “him” with “her” or “<a href="http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/173/a/d/Cousin_IT_by_Nastyguy.jpg">it</a>” in the above sentence.
I recommend taking a firm stance with these people. Read Manga in the
nude, in your living room, talk to yourself loudly at night, save your
urine. Just something to snap them out of their haze.</p>

<p>Fuck, this makes me <a href="http://youtu.be/4r7wHMg5Yjg">sound like one of these guys</a>….</p>

        Chaos Development
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>When you start a project of any kind do you start by typing something
into a <a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYY2yj7B5cE/0.jpg">terminal</a> or do you begin on a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/">piece of paper</a>? Many
developers probably start by typing some stuff out but rarely, perhaps
like our <a href="http://designers.mx/post/list/everyone/all">designer brethren</a>, do we begin with <a href="http://www.paddlepalace.com/">analog tools</a>.
Why? Is it because developers feel more at home with a bunch of
<a href="http://blog.lenovo.com/images/uploads/hero/TopView_T430s_crop.jpg">chicklet keys</a> or do we generally have no use for sketching
features out?</p>

<p>There is definitely a place for a great <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-Gel-Ink-Pens/ct/284">pen</a> and piece of <a href="http://doanepaper.com/">paper</a> in the
beginning and subsequent phases of software dev. Perhaps not to sketch
things out logically but, to <a href="http://youtu.be/n-mpifTiPV4">chaotically</a> write features everywhere. Jot
down table names, feature ideas, needed gems, future plans, whatever.
The only rule being, never stay within the lines!</p>

<p>Find a <a href="http://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_dotPad.shtml">notebook</a> that is layed out in a dot-grid or a traditional
line grid. This alone absolves the need to write everything down on a
line starting from the left and moving to the right. You can start
anywhere, and go anywhere which leaves your brain free to jot down
anything and add to it later. This type of <a href="http://rlv.zcache.com/freedumb_tshirt-p235916646013340812enwjh_210.jpg">freedom</a> is much more
constrained when it comes to interacting with text using just a keyboard
and mouse (yes, I am making an assumption that you don’t have a fancy
Cintiq).</p>

<p>The ability to be chaotic is priceless and something that should be
cultivated during the entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">life-cycle</a> of any “software project”.
If you have never thought about grabbing a piece of paper and writing
out things, give it a whirl. If you happen to be <a href="http://www.healthexpertadvice.org/forum/Allergies/Allergic-to-toilet-paper-40038.htm">allergic to
paper</a>…well, then maybe take this advice with a grain of salt.</p>
