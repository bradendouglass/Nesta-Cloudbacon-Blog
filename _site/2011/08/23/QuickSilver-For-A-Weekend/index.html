  <h1 class="post-title">Quicksilver Still Can't Make The Cut</h1>
  <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2011</span>
  <p>It’s true, I have never really been much of a fan of the ancient productivity
guru known as “Quicksilver”. It was adopted by all my Mac loving brethren and
even, after several ad-hoc presentations, I continued to obstain. Launchbar was
too small and Spotlight, if mastered couldn’t come close to both the 3rd party
applications. In addition, everytime Quicksilver was left to rot due to an
ambitious developer(s) realizing the size of the project, I was content knowing
there was no need to lament.</p>

<p>Recently the Quicksilver Project was <a href="http://www.qsapp.com">picked up</a> by a
group of very talented and driven developers who have a laundry list of grand
plans for the ailing product. With Quicksilver making a rapid comeback, I
decided to drop my current productivity love affair:
<a href="www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> and give the beast a whirl for the span of a long
weekend(4-5 days).</p>

<p><strong>User Experience</strong>  Quicksilver still has one of the best looking UXs for its
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_\(software\)">time</a>. It jumps into
view with big blocks that are easy to see and clearly show the user what they
are doing at the very moment. Launchbar, with its tiny “unibar” easily fails
hard in this category. Quicksilver’s simple select what you want to do(noun),
tab over to select an action(verb), and if needed, a location approach to doing
things is truly brilliant! If a mistake is made, the user just tabs back to the
problem, fixes it and goes about their merry way. Alfred and Launchbar both
prescribe to a “unibar” philosophy which can be confusing if the user forgets
where they are in their launching process.</p>

<p><strong>Functionality</strong>  These applications construct a higher amount of
functionality over Spotlight(OS X default), hence why many of us use them.
Alfred isn’t more than a few years old which means 99% of its functionality
works great on a new, Intel powered, Lion running Mac. Lock, Shutdown, and
other system commands function beautifully (NOT true with Quicksilver) along
with the clipboard, file navigation, etc. Quicksilver continues to be burdened
with the cruft from its days being build on and for the PPC architecture and
man, does it show:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The app doesn’t run in 64bit mode</li>
  <li>Many of the plugins haven’t been updated in 4+ years (they are working on
  it)</li>
  <li>Several of the apps rely on the PPC architecture which isn’t supported in
  Snow Leopard or Lion (SL was released in August 2009)</li>
  <li>The app itself continues to be flaky with several crashes per day under
  heavy use</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Extensibility</strong>  Quicksilver is known for having an incredibly robust plugin
structure.
1Password, Bbedit, Vim, Photos, FlickrUploads, and etc are just a few that are
at the user’s fingertip. As a self proclaimed “power-user” this excites me.
However, several weeks ago Alfred implemented the ability to run applescripts,
shell scripts, and automator workflows. Although Qucksilver has a leg up with
the raw amount of extensions, many of them need updating because of their age.
I am genuinly excited to see what kind of plugins are developed by Alfred’s
robust and seeminly clever community. Here are just a few so far: <a href="http://blog.alfredapp.com/2011/08/02/alfred-extensions/">Alfred
Extensions</a></p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong>  At the end of the weekend I simply couldn’t wait to fire back
up Alfred and get back to work. Sure there is always a problem of knowing how
to access similar functions in new applications, however; this wasn’t specific
to my case. I spent a good portion of time tweaking and “groking” the
Quicksilver way (a good 2-5 hours). However, was ultimately unimpressed with
its high crash rate (running on a 1st gen 17inch(2.66C2D/8gigs) Unibody w/ SSD
+ Optibay), inconsistent plugin compatibility, and the amount of time it took
to rescan for new items(fairly sure Quicksilver continues to use its own index,
not Spotlight’s). For the immediate future, this nerd is sticking with Alfred.
In addition, I have a powerpack licences for Alfred so if you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wiltj">don’t feel like
assisting really cool developers</a>, yet want
some of the functionality mentioned above, stick with Quicksilver as a free
solution.</p>
