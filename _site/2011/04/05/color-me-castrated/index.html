<p>You probably have never heard of it but,
<a href="http://www.color.com/">Color</a> is a new photo sharing app for the
iPhone. Although it might be fairly unknown, this app has already garnished a
healthy 41 million dollars in venture capital from the fabled Valley firm:
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2011/tc20110324_504360.htm">Sequoia Captial</a>. To put that number into perspective, that is <strong>more</strong>
than Sequoia gave Google in the early days. Let’s start with what the haters
are saying and move into something more positive.</p>

<p>Uncle Leo Laporte on his fabled <a href="http://twit.tv/twit">TwiT</a> radio
show called Color a waste of money and an immediate failure.
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a> picked up a few pieces but, in
general was echoed out by a wonderfully large group of people on Leo’s side.
This sentiment seems to be transcending throughout the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=color+41+million&amp;tbm=blg">blogosphere</a>,
with very few positive voices squeaking through. Much of this mashing of teeth
derives from these people seeing no real value in the product, certainly not
the pro-ported 100+ million dollar evaluation.</p>

<p>At its core, Color is just another photo sharing application that is currently
stuck on the iOS platform. Its functionality might be reminiscent of
<a href="http://picplz.com/">Picplz</a> or <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> but, this is where the
generalizations stop. The kick-ass function baked into Color is its ability to
create ad-hoc social photo networks (streams) on the fly. The application uses
the phone’s built-in GPS along with an audio key to pair users together. There
is no friending people, no you follow someone; however, just being near each
other create the essence of “following.” Pretty fucking cool.</p>

<p>I have fiddled with the app for a bit and since I live with some iPhone touting
nerds, it is easy to see the value in the technology. It is incredibly fun to
see photos taken by friends pop into the local feed. People perceive this
mostly hilarious world in such different ways and I believe this app grasps
this better than anything currently available. You are able to see what people
are focused on, what they care about, and what they think (comments are baked
in) all in real-time. It gives the user the ability to experience every
situation in a party where before he/she was trapped to what was directly in
front of him/her. Not to worry though, there are some definite rough spots.</p>

<p>Unless you live around people who have access to an iPhone you are pretty much
out of luck unless you happen to be checking the application while at the park
and pair up with random folk. It is doubtful that this pitfall will ever go
away since this is really what the entirety of the application hinges on.
Moreover and before a much-needed update, the interface was extremely bizarre.
Icons didn’t really make much sense and you had to stumble your way through the
experience until you grasped what was really going on.</p>

<p>Sure there are a few shortcomings but, the technology is new, it’s being used
in a chat application called <a href="http://yobongo.com/">Yobongo</a> and
really nothing else that I am aware of at this very moment. With the
high potential for failure(not exactly true when you have 41 million burning a
whole in your pocket) I believe that the Color team has made something truly
interesting in a sea of “meh” experiences. And let’s be honest, why the fuck
are all these “tech elites and taste makers” hating on a modicum of innovation
in the Valley? Get out from behind your ancient blogs and podcasts and make
something disruptive!</p>
