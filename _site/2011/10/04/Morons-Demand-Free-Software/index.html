  <h1 class="post-title">On Demanding Free Awesome-Software</h1>
  <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2011</span>
  <p>If…perhaps you had been sitting under a chair hiding from your
coffin-death-sled this week (Oct 3), the peeps behind the wonderful app
<a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> released their new itteration on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12">Mac App
Store</a>. If you happened
to click on the previous link, you would have realized that Growl has
transitioned itself from something free to something worth $1.99. With most
transitions of this manner, there has been a
<a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">metric-shit-ton</a> of user outcry.</p>

<p>Growl(an extremely short history) has been the defacto OS X(it does function on
windows), that’s “Macz” for all you <a href="http://youtu.be/migIVbzPW5U">nubs</a>,
notification software since August of 2004. Most people forget that the app was
a preference pane tucked away in system preferences. In many cases, Growl came
packaged with other applications that installed it to handle their own
notifications. Thereby relieving the user from ever having to worry about
whether it(Growl) was installed or not.</p>

<p>However, now we need to download it from the Mac App Store or MAS if you like
acronyms…and you need to PAY FOR IT! Holy SHIT, like for realz? Pay for it?
For all of you who feel like you are entitled to awesome software, and Growl
falls under this moniker, for free…you’re not. Not-Sorry.</p>

<p>These moochers are the same asshats who jailbreak their iPhones to simply
download apps without paying. Although, there are plenty of really great paid
apps on the <a href="http://youtu.be/migIVbzPW5U">Cydia</a> store. They spend hours of
their time searching for free versions of applications that cost them 2.99. The
real problem, before I go over the deep end, is: these developers are not
Adobe.</p>

<p>They are a small team of good friends who have banded together and spent a lot
of time, sweat, and tears to build something that they hope can turn into a
miniture business. They might have shitty jobs, hard families, or whatever but,
they are there to make an attempt at bettering their overall living situation.
You consistently stealing their apps isn’t assisting them in any way.</p>

<p>In addition, people should be pining to pay for this software, especially
Growl, because it truly is kick ass. It should be your honor and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_(Japanese\)">giri</a> to pay for these great
products. The minimal payment helps feed the developers and allows them to
focus on the software that you have paid for and love.</p>

<p>Make a budget per week, pay for the software that you love, revel in the fact
that you have helped someone reach their dream and someone might reciprocate on
it when you near yours.</p>
