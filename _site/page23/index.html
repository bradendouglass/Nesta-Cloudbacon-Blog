        Mac App Store and Bootable Images
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2011</span>

    <p>Anyone worth their Mac loving salt knows how hardware agnostic the OS is. Need
to send your main computer in for repair because of a faulty batch of
harddrives but, want to avoid being out a machine for a couple of important
days?</p>

<p>A bootable image is a “snapshot” of everything that is going on at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_\(data_storage\)">block
level</a> of your OS. In most
cases, these images are captured using a firewire drive (hopefully soon to be
Thunderbold drive) and can be used to run any other piece of Apple
hardware(computers, not iPads). Well sort of.</p>

<p>PPC architecture images can ONLY be booted with PPC Macs and the same goes for
Intel. In addition, a Lion image won’t even boot on an old coreDuo machine
(anyone seen a workaround?). Downtime is reduced to nothing with this
method…or usually. For some reason, several of the apps that were purchased
from the App Store, annoy the user on startup for a username and password.
However when entered, the app simply dissapears. Wonder if anyone else is
seeing odd behavior like this?</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2011</span>

    <p>Like the rest of the intelligent world, I run all of my development life on a
Mac laptop. The Unix underneath is exactly what the doctor ordered. However, my
February 2009 17inch Macbook Pro is beginning to show it’s age . This model
roughly translates to a Core2Duo shoved into Apple’s newly updated 17’ unibody
for anyone who doesn’t have Apple’s processor usage
	<a href="http://www.mactracker.ca/">memorized</a>.</p>

<p>Hemming-and-hawing over the brand new Air’s was extremely difficult because
they are insanely fast, however; are still probably not the best choice for a
single computer setup. In addition, there wasn’t much of a chance that I would
be buying a brand new MBP this year. Especially with the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/07/26/apple-finishing-up-work-on-an-ultra-thin-15-notebook/">heavy
rumors</a>
that the entire line might be updated in late 2011/2012 (If you are looking for
a computer and need one, don’t wait, nothing is definite).</p>

<p>The choice fell on upgrading my current machine, so where to start for anyone
in the same place?  Maxing out your ram never hurts (8 gigs in most MBPs) but,
by far the best upgrade for money is jumping on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">SSD</a> wagon. Most of the
latency that is witnessed in every-day computing is built around how fast you
can access your files and an SSD will drastically lower said latency. A final
and somewhat, hardware-hacker route is to add a secondary hard drive in the
place of the internal SuperDrive.</p>

<p>Since there is no new hardware in my near future, the decision was simple:
upgrade all 3. 8 gigs of ram, <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167052">120gig
SSD</a>, an
<a href="http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/">optibay drive</a>, and a
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148591&amp;Tpk=momentus%20xt">hybrid</a>
500gig secondary drive.  A word of warning for people pining to move out their
SuperDrive, use the manuals at <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Browse/Mac">iFixit</a>. With
all unibody MacBook Pros you need to move the bluetooth module from the
internal SuperDrive onto the new optibay. This can be a little tricky due to
the fact that the holes in the optibay are NOT pre-threaded. In addition, the
bluetooth module has small screws, cramped angles, and is just a PIA for anyone
with fingers larger than a 3 year old.</p>

<p>The result is a worthwhile upgrade and a computer that handles Lion with
blazing speed. Below are a couple of tweaks that I recommend if going down the
SSD route OR buying an optibay.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Obtibay</em>: Two hard drives spinning at the same time will definitely reduce
  your battery life. In addition, people frequently complain that there isn’t
  much cooling going on in the optibay. The fix is to spin the drive up and
  down <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=9596575#post9596575">when
  needed</a>. I
  connected the scripts to <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> so the drive
  can be easily managed. <a href="http://qsapp.com/">Quicksilver</a> would also work
  here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>SSD</em>: OS X and even Lion fail to be truly built for SSDs(from the ground up).
  Hot File Clustering, which basically tracks frequently used files and moves
  them into the outer-rim is still enabled at the kernel level.  Aww…last
  time I checked SSDs don’t have “outer-rims” like their spinning platter slow
  cousins from the north. Anyway, here are a few
  <a href="http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?52845-Mac-OSX-Speed-Tweaks&amp;highlight=osx%20tweaks">tweaks</a>
  that can be used to improve your SSD experience on OS X.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>SSD/Trim</em>: Trim support is still only supported for Apple branded SSDs. Not
  to worry, there is an easy way to <a href="http://gdgt.com/question/in-os-x-lion-how-do-you-enable-trim-support-for-ssds-f16/">get it
  functioning</a>
  with 3rd party drives.  Please, don’t use Trim Enabler on Lion! The patch is
  based on the 10.6.8 kernel and has yet to be updated (as of 2011.08.02).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>SSD</em>: Install a fresh version of Lion, from a USB key or CD. Imaging an old,
  spinning drive doesn’t make sense if you are migrating to a much quicker
  SSD. Moreover, it is likely that there are a ton of unused files and junk
  “cruft” sitting on your hard drive.  Install fresh, rebuild and be happy
  that everything is clean and as new as possible.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

        Three Finger Swipe In Lion
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jul 2011</span>

    <p>If you haven’t heard, there was quite a major update to some random <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">OS</a>
this week. With every update, and one done through digital means, there is
bound to be a few “hickups” here-and-there. One of Lion’s most prominent issues
is the 3 finger space switching. This one, somewhat insignificant item seems to
have <a href="http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck">brainfucked</a> many people when it comes to certain applications.</p>

<p>Swiping left and right with three fingers used to navigate back and forth in
browsers, flipped through sections in Twitter for Mac, along with bringing up
the application switcher(I believe this was a four finger swipe option). Now,
this gesture seems to jump from one desktop space, to another. Well with a
little help from an application called <a href="http://www.bettertouchtool.net/">BetterTouchTool</a> there is a possible
solution:</p>

<p>Keyboard shortcuts have been around for years, and many gestures (old and new)
can be fired off by simply touching the correct keys in an awesome order. One
could, if they had the self control to rip themselves away from bitching about
the new Mac OS X, map the cmd + ] and [ keys to mimic the lost features of Snow
Leopard. In addition, BetterTouchTool can take modifier keys, unlike the base
gesture list. This, roughly translated, means that it is possible to gain those
three finger gestures back if you include the option key along for the
ride…Rambling managed:</p>

<p>cmd + ] =&gt; this will mimic a snow leopard three finger swipe right
cmd + [ =&gt; the opposite. I hope you don’t think the hashrocket is included…</p>

involved. The meeting starts and voila! You wake up 50 minutes later swimming
in a pool of your own drool. Not to mention, some angry coworkers commenting on

<p>Sweden, in their infinite dislike for automotive speeding have come up with
something truly brilliant: <a href="http://www.anti-powerpoint-party.com/en">The Anti Powerpoint Party</a>. We all dislike them,
so why hasn’t anyone come up with this before now? Oh well, here is a very

        Syntax Highlighters in Nanoc
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2011</span>

    <p>Code highlighting with say, Wordpress is an absolute breeze. All that is
required is finding the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=code+highlighting">plugin</a> that suits your fancy. This isn’t quite as
easy when using a solution like <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a> or any other Ruby based static site
generator. This is due to the fact that all of your files are compiled on the
fly into html, instead of being held in a database and being “served” every
time someone visits your site (ala Wordpress/Drupal). For the person who is
smart enough to run a static site, don’t fret. You have several great options
that are dying for implementation.</p>

<p>The two that come to mind are <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> and <a href="http://coderay.rubychan.de/">CodeRay</a>. CodeRay is built
with Ruby so it is as easy as:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=gem install"></script>

<p>However, since Pygments is Python specific, we need a little wrapper to make it
work in our Ruby environment. A quick search on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> leads us to
<a href="https://github.com/github/albino">Albino</a>…a wrapper for Pygments. Since it is a wrapper we need to nab
Pygments by invoking:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=pygmrents"></script>

<p>and then:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=gem albino"></script>

<p>For Cloudbacon, I have decided to stick with the Albino gem. The syntax is
easier to write and much more svelte overall. In addition, another Github (I
hang out there a lot) user has a wonderful set of <a href="https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css">css stylesheets</a> that
work flawlessly with Albino and Pygments. Simply include the gem in Nanoc’s
Rules file, right before the routes, and add the css file (named ‘default.css’)
into the output directory. Easy - code highlighting.</p>

<p>Some people might ask why I didn’t use the <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/api/3.1/Nanoc3/Filters/ColorizeSyntax.html">colorize_syntax filter</a> offered
by Nanoc itself? Well I did get it to work; however, you need to break down the
css output and create your own stylesheet. I love writing <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> as much as
the next person but, automation is just that much cooler. Get your Nanoc site
under version control and try all three methods, see which one works best, and
get your code out of block quotes. Since the above several lines are bash, and
bash has no color, here is a simple ruby test:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=hello world"></script>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Funny thing being, I now rely on gist code snippets to get the job done.</p>
