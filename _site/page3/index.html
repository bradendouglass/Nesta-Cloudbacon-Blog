        Photography
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>At one time or another, there was an attempt in my life to be a bit of a photographer. A cool, Canon DSLR sat in my hands from when college finished into the latter years of my 20’s. For some reason, there was always a form of hesitation to take it out of it’s case and snap pictures. Even when my wife and I lived in the splendor that is Jackson Wyoming.</p>

<p>In the end, the camera was given to my mother in law. She seemed to have the tenacity to pull it out and snap pictures far more often than I ever exhibited. Lately though there has been an intense burning to get back into some form of photography. Now though, I don’t want there to be a need to find new lenses, to build a base of items. No, just a simple camera, that takes stunning photos and is there to capture life.</p>

<p>This is what is pulling me towards photography as a whole. The idea of capture. It is slow, deliberate and most often times an utter failure. The idea is that it will slow life down, make it seem more real and less of a blur. This in itself is hard to do and I would personally love to hear from anyone, photographer or not, how they calm down this ever-present blur of life.</p>

        Returns And Deploying Bower/Rails Things
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Recently things have been fairly spartan around here. This isn’t your fault as an <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2011-12-19-People-Can-Not-Read">avid reader</a> but, more of time spent upping my skills at what can now only be dubbed <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/3315-railsconf-keynote-writing-software">‘computer writing’</a>. Also buying a home, moving, visiting friends and generally being as normal of a person as possible in my shoes might have a little to do with the absence.</p>

<p>Regardless of all that hoopla, there are tentative plans to do a 350 word, 30 day writing sprint coming up soon. All these pro-ported items will be collected right here (<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50730705aac422613b000001/big">don’t fret</a>). However, here’s a <a href="http://blog.godynamo.com/">post that I wrote for people who maybe having a hell-of-a time</a> getting their <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>-backed Rails applications deployed on <a href="https://www.cloud66.com/">Cloud66</a>. While you are there, I highly recommend reading the other posts… because they are written by folks much smarter than this guy.</p>

        AppSignal And Cloud66 Deploys
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>Peter Berkenbosch wrote an <a href="http://peterberkenbosch.nl/appsignal-deploy-notification-with-cloud66-deploy-hook/">interesting piece</a> on how to notify <a href="https://appsignal.com">AppSignal</a> that your code has had a successful deploy from <a href="https://www.cloud66.com">Cloud66</a>. This is a somewhat understated need by the folks at AppSignal. Errors from a deployed application are actually tallied up for each deploy. Meaning if never notified of different or subsequent deploys, AppSignal will shelve everything under 1 deploy. UI wise this is a bit of a shit show.</p>

<p>While Peter’s shell command is nice, it’s a bit verbose and I have had some issues accessing <code>HEAD</code> while in the deploy directory. That’s why I built this script:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/braidn/10652341.js"></script>

<p>While it’s a little long (much longer that <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width">80c</a>), it uses Git log which we have easy access to in any Git repo. In no way am I saying that this script trumps Peters; it just happens to be different. Marry this to the <code>deploy_hooks.yml</code> example in Peter’s post and you will be quickly alerting AppSignal every time there is a deploy.</p>

        The Long Troll
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Feb 2014</span>

    <p>One off Interent trolling isn’t anything new, nor is it something that could be construed as hard. Someone jumps into a conversation, drops a bombshell and walks away. They never have to feel the consequenses or even play a second hand. They are in and out.</p>

<p>The <em>long troll</em> is where someone enters the conversation, slightly alters the direction and then continues to repeat the cycle. <a href="https://twitter.com/LocalHouseBar/status/437286354196508672">Perhaps the original recipient intended something to be both informative and marketable</a>. However, your mind warped their intentions into something that was not only extremely giggleable but, something that you can continue to giggle at.</p>

<p>The best part about long trolling is the likelyhood that both parties win. The original person doesn’t feel slighted, in fact, they often feel overwhelmed that someone on the Internet is talking directly to them. Moreover, the trolling party get’s their giggles and remains the smug human they think they are. Just remember, long trolls are your friends, and quick trolls or “trolls” are just dicks.</p>

    <p>Rarely has there been anything worth a reblrrg around here in quite a while. However, this morning I stumbled across <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6">this brilliant</a> article outlining several avenues on “how to be great”. If you value humility, even a little bit, this article is priceless.</p>
