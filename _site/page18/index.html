    <p>A few weeks ago something so terrible, so…unbelievably…terrible happened to my beloved Ifone: It <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/172/198/Y0pTu.png">fell</a>. Specifically, it fell out of my ridiculous <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mcwetboy/1862552444/sizes/z/in/photostream/">brace</a> and onto pavement. Upon inspection, I realized that my foolhardy <a href="http://www.edition20.com/images/products/382/Zig-Zag-280-by-Cassina-by-Gerrit-Thomas-Rietveld-image-1.jpg">meneuver</a> had cost me a refurb iPhone. Had I had the <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">brainz</a> to have purchased one of <a href="http://feinger.com/">these</a>, everything would be unliterraly “smashing” at the moment. Man, I love how the popularity of the iPhone continues to allow shitty ideas to prosper.</p>

    <p>And we have reached another proverbial Friday, although mark my
words, I am not counting. I think. First of all, there needs to be a
good amount of explanation concerning the fascination with these “Friday
posts”. However, I would like to make an astute observation before I move on. The
keyboard on this 17 MBP is absolute shit.</p>

<p>Anyway, my plan with these Friday rants is to really just try and sum up
a small segment of the week. Whether it be the state of political
affairs like last Friday, or perhaps something crushing about the local
field mouse population. Nothing very heavy, just something that will
make you giggle on a Friday afternoon…when you are probably
drunk and flipping through your RSS reader because you are alone due to
the fact that you know what RSS is. So without further ado, here we go:</p>

<p>It appears that America has finally found itself a suitable and fitting
<a href="http://www.covered2go.co.uk/_assets/wwf.gif">past-time</a>: <a href="http://www.wwl.com/Louisiana-man-accused-of-biting---a-chunk-of-the-v/13347809">Zombieism</a>. That’s right <a href="http://youtu.be/4awVqRr1eCo">another zombie attack</a> was
chronicled this week in yet another, hopeless Southern State. No, go
ahead and take a wild guess. <a href="http://youtu.be/8vuZ8jSVNUI">Yup</a> that’s right the great state of
Lousiana and all of it’s possible zombie infested inhabitants…welcome
to the danger zone. Best part? Yeah, apparently bath salts, when used
correctly have the potential to throw homeless people into a state of
“excited delirium and dangerous behavior”. Frankly, those are two
emotions…or whatever, that I wouldn’t want to explore while in a bath
tub. Moral behind all of these attacks? <a href="http://www.motivationals.org/demotivational-posters/demotivational-poster-7861.jpg">Be safe, be seen</a>.</p>

    <p>Below is a conversation with what I can only guess is a young man over a
current classified item I have up <a href="http://greensboro.craigslist.org/bik/2992518454.html">for sale</a> on the Craigslists.</p>

<p>His original response to the posting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello! let’s do like this, actually now I’m not in town for now, I came to visit my son so i wont be able to meet with you but am okay with the price as seen on the advert, I’ll proceed in issuing a Check out to you and when you received the check , I will make arrangement for pick-up. So get back to me with below details asap.
Name:
Address:
City:
State:
Postal Code:
Phone Number:
And as soon as this is provided, the payment will be overnight to you and i will let you know when its mailed out. I need you to be honest with the sale as I am a God fearing person.
Thanks
God Bless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Needless to say, I felt that a response was required:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you were a God fearing person you should know that God eats
Internet scammers and spammers and shits them out into a very special
place in Hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For one, yes “Internet” is still uppercased, I am not sure what the
folks at the AP are on. And second, I am glad that he/she/it believes
that everyone in the South (sometimes pronounced…with emphasis: “THE
SOUTH”) would believe this drivel due to their love. Errrr. Fear of “Gawd”. Also, did
I miss something? Why the fuck is the word “Check” capitalized? Maybe
that’s their name.</p>
