    <p>This should come to no surprise to anyone: I love searching for jobs.
When you have been fired as many times as I have from yobs, you learn to
enjoy the process that is involved in nailing one down. Yes, this makes
me perfect for the freelance role; however, I have yet to find a way to
break into that club.</p>

<p>Anyway, I spent this Friday in a “<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502bb359aac422024400002d/big">surprise interview</a>” and nailed
every last section besides…yep, you guessed it: the technical section.
It isn’t that I freeze or can’t answer their questions, it is the simple
fact that writing code on a whiteboard is the least functional way to
figure out what someone knows. The equivalent is <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big">this</a>. And,
personally, my hips aren’t that mobile.</p>

<p>One of the best techincal interviews I ever had the grace to be apart of
was with <a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a>. It was all over the phone, no code writing on a
fucking whiteboard, and 100% of it relevant to what occurs while working
with a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)">brown field app</a>”. If you are a hiring manger, please think
carefully about your technical questions and <strong>DON’T</strong> make the
participant scribble their answer on a board.</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: <a href="http://seeknuance.com/2008/02/15/interview-whiteboard-coding-tests-are-usually-worthless/">This blog post</a> nicely defines some of the more “technical”
reasons behind why programming on whiteboards makes little sense.</p>

    <p>Since you are a kick-ass developer, you own a Macbook Air (most of us
do) yet, you are constantly pressed
for moah hard drive space. With Xcode being a bit “<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big">portly</a>”, “there has
got to be a better way”…to do stuff. The kick-ass peeps at
<a href="http://thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a> have a wonderful <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/27985816073/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-riding-a-mountain-lion">post</a> walking someone through
setting up a sweet Ruby dev environment on a brand new, Mountain Lion
powered Mac.</p>

<p>Once that is done, send some sweet traffic to this <a href="http://coderwall.com/p/dtbuqg">post</a>. It
walks through some needed tweaks when running the <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Interesting-Taps-%26-Branches">homebrew-dupes</a> version
of gcc. Finally, run this command in your favorite shell to tell NVM
(and other “items of importance”) where your Xcode installation
“resides”:</p>

<p><code>sudo xcode-select -switch /usr/local/bin</code></p>

<p>Now when you run <code>nvm install v.0.x.x</code> it won’t fail because you feel
Xcode is a bloated pig and it doesn’t deserve your hard drive’s
time-of-day. In addition, you have a lean, mean way to build some really
cool shit with two awesome languages.</p>

    <p>To think that this blog went through a steep declined after August is a
damn crying shame. Also, I could have been <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5045518529ca15f836000020/big">lost</a> but, that is
neither <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f67e29ca154572000000/big">here</a> nor there. Also, and perhaps a complete surprise is a
post about shit I actually do…like for a living. Without further ado:</p>

<p>It should come to no surprise to the <a href="http://www.ardmorelibrary.org/literacy/images/oneoutoffive.jpg">readers of this blog</a> (that
poster is sandbagging) that I love <a href="https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans">Ruby koans</a>. Specifically the
ones maintained by the wonderful people at Edgecase. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan#Varieties_in_koan-practice">Koans</a>, for the
peeps who have no clue are a staple in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382?tag=duckduckgo-d-20">apprenticeship movement</a>
and are an easy and repeatable way to hone your skills.</p>

<p>Ok so practicing is a good thing, but how do we make said practice more
fluid? To accomplish fluid…ness, is that right? We are going to need
some tools, of which might be a little frightening to the new sotware
developer. Don’t fret:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Vim</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benmills/vimux">Vimux</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">Tmux</a></li>
  <li>Some <a href="http://media.screened.com/uploads/0/5115/407558-airbud1_super.jpg">bud</a></li>
</ol>

<p>One of the biggest problems people have with koans is the tedium of
jumping back and forth between your editor and terminal to run the <code>rake</code>
command. Problem solved. Open your current koan with Vim in the terminal.
You can throw MacVim <a href="http://thegrio.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/romney-looking-out-the-window-16x9.jpg?w=650">out the window</a> (the fact that we can fly still amazes that guy). Create a split(vertical) window with
Tmux and navigate up a directory to where the rakefile is located. Hop
back over to your Vim instance and initiate: Vimux-RunVimTmuxCommand.
For me this is bound to <code>leader rp</code>, type “rake” and BOOM. Your koan
information should be stdout…ing.</p>

<p>No need to actually jump to the adjacent tmux window, no need to jump
out of your typing environment, and no need to break your awesome koan-like
focus. Another hat tip would be to use the RunVimTmuxLastCommand instead
of having to continually type rake in the the Vimux window. BOOM! Fluidity
leveled up.</p>

    <span class="post-date">03 Sep 2012</span>

    <p>If you agree with <a href="http://wasigh.com/scariest-thing-resigned/">this post</a> we have a problem. Srsly, like dialing
<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5045518529ca15f836000020/big">Houston</a> at this-very-moment <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340b0029ca154d3d000026/big">problem</a>. If saying goodbye to
employment with a company that you don’t own is the scariest thing you
can think of… I don’t know, go think of these <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2012/jul/30/ants/">ants</a>. They are
about 1 million times more scary than quiting a job.</p>

<p>Oh, and feel free to <a href="http://www.vimninjas.com/2012/09/03/5-plugins-you-should-put-in-your-vimrc/">not download these plugins</a>. Also, how about
the scariest thing you could think of is getting traffic tanked by
Hacker News? It is 9-est on Monday (<a href="http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/webster/">Labour</a> day) and there is 0
access.</p>
