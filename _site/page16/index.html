        Leave MacVim To The Noobz

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>If it wasn’t painfully obvious from my <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">tweeting</a>, I spent the better
half of the first weekend of August, at <a href="http://steelcityrubyconf.org/">a Ruby conference</a>. The one
topic that I was fairly positive would <a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1161/953433678_f1cdac15f5.jpg">creep up</a>, yet somehow
<a href="http://www.officialpsds.com/images/thumbs/Care-Bears-psd38826.png">magically flew away</a>, was the “editor talk.” No one was comparing
their Vim configs to people’s lowly Textmate installs. No Emacs vs
Sublime Text 2, nothing really. Damn shame.</p>

<p>What did show it’s face, was people’s love of Sublime Text 2. Wait for the
cmd-tab, wait for it…wait. BOOM! Sublime Text. If it wasn’t ST2, then
it was the dreaded MacVim; hater-instiling that you forcibly cmd-tab (that is a <a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-jMFKFfLHVjY/UCDVwf66tlI/AAAAAAAAD5I/DdnlV635SWY/this%252520keyboard%252520is%252520not%252520quite%252520in%252520my%252520reach%25252017%252520June.jpg">fucking reach</a>) everywhere.
MacVim users probably silently wish that they could cmd-tab through their
legs to <a href="http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a97173_g114_4-ny.jpg">speed up their walking pace</a>.</p>

<p>I know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why</a> told us that opinions (he used the word “tastes”) would <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2011-05-10-why-the-lucky-stiff-quote">begin to
define</a> us over what we created; however, I draw the line at being
defined by how many times I can cmd-tab faster than the next person. To
help all of you cmd-tab loving folks (I have fucked my cmd-tab seo on
this post), here is a list of really cool things to get you back into
terminal Vim.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a look at updating OS X’s default version with this <a href="http://www.cloudbacon.com/2012-07-03-Vim-Can-Suck">post</a></li>
  <li>Being at the terminal level allows you to <strong>NOT</strong> cmd-tab to it. This
in itself will speed you up tremendously.</li>
  <li>Download and use <a href="http://www.linuxcertif.com/man/1/tmux/">tmux</a>. It has a learning curve but is well
worth it for when you start pair programming and as a damn-good
terminal multiplexer</li>
  <li>Seriously, download and use tmux. It can be found and installed via
brew and you can even <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux">buy a book about it</a></li>
  <li>If this is your first <a href="http://teamsteevo.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/fail-owned-cow-curiosity-fail.jpg">rodeo</a>, find a great set of defaults,
either through <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> or <a href="https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles">Yadr</a>.</li>
  <li>Read through what the above config files do, test and try every last
section</li>
  <li>Go <a href="https://learn.thoughtbot.com/vim">here</a>, read it all. They are way smarter than I am and always
have great blog posts on developmenty things.</li>
</ol>

<p>Give it two weeks. <a href="http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/">Close MacVim</a>, find a terminal that you can
stand, download tmux and give your new-found freedom a whirl. Then send
me a <a href="http://twitter.com/braidn">message</a> on the Twitters and tell me how it is going.</p>

        3 Things
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Due to the <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/rr-60-solid-with-jim-weirich/">abnormal size</a> of my <a href="http://i51.tinypic.com/2135flx.jpg">cranial hair follicals</a>, it has been
deemed illegal to wear <a href="http://www.askaprice.com/res/images/articles/cycle-helmet-female_299x403.jpg">items on my head</a> in the great state of <a href="http://parislemon.com/post/28600694849/wired-apple-is-building-something-new-at-its">North
Carolina</a>. Lots of folks also have a problem with “where in the world” North Carolina
is so I think a picture of an Apple data center should help out.
Regardless of, this entire post is not about <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jockew/4636027374/sizes/l/in/photostream/">facial hair</a>, <a href="http://www.seofaction.com/images/postgres.jpg">elephants</a>
(like the one from Postgres), or North Carolina. Nope, it is actually a list.
A list of three passion-things to be exact.</p>

<p>Our puny brains have a <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=multitasking+iz+bad">hard time doing a lot of things at once</a>. The
more we attempt to focus on, the worse and worse everything seems to get
around us. This is why I am advocating the idea of “<a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">3 Things</a>.”
Factor everything you do down into just three things and you will find
yourself free and clear to focus and dominate whatever three you choose.</p>

<p>Let’s not be too harsh though. What I am not advocating is throwing away
your sense of adventure and settle. Explore, find things that are
fearful, scary, fun, gas-y, etc and when you do find something that you
want to add to your three list, do so with a <a href="http://youtu.be/xP1-oquwoL8">fervor unmatched by anyone</a>!
Over time you will begin to hone skills that are integral to succeeding
at your three chosen passions. As time ticks by, you might sub out one
passion for another; however, make sure that you simply table your skill
sets, never throw them away.</p>

<p>Best of all! Write them down so your puny brain doesn’t forget.</p>

<ol>
  <li>My Wife: understanding her, loving her, being there when I am needed.
Although the whole partner thing is hard it is well worth it.</li>
  <li>Programming: A field I find myself in love with more and more every
LOC that is written.</li>
  <li>Crossfit: High pain tolerance, focus, and a never retreat
attitude is rarely prized in sports. I am glad something like this
exists.</li>
</ol>

<p>Simple. Write down and dive into yours right now!</p>

        30 Minute Tarcks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>If you happen to be an uneducated <a href="https://peepcode.com/">peep</a> who doesn’t quite grok the
idea of the <a href="http://wikibin.org/articles/tarck-bike.html">“tarck”</a>…well, then I can’t help you. However, for the
remainder of this post tarck won’t be used in terms of <a href="http://derper.com/images/derp/Have_You_Ever_Herped_So_Hard_You_Derped_.jpg">bikez</a>.</p>

<p>Today was the last day of a truly awesome Ruby convention in Pittsburgh
(pronounced “Pittz-burf” by <a href="http://twitter.com/brandonburke">someone</a> potentially brilliant) dubbed:
Steel City Ruby Conf. Otherwise known as <a href="http://people.delphiforums.com/JITRBUG/scrc239logo.jpg">“SCRC”</a>. Of which I
thought was a motorcycle group, but as always, it is good to be wrong. At
this conference, along with <a href="http://grok.cc/">Greenville</a> <a href="https://drwaww7dh1loc.cloudfront.net/learning_preview/14305/image/large_grok.jpg">Grok</a> the focus was put
on the 30 minute inbetween sessions.</p>

<p>This meant that although the speaker line up was potentially insane at
SCRC, the organizers put a <a href="http://developingux.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/solid_thumb.jpg">large amount of weight</a> on the
human interaction between the talks. I find there to be a few problems
with this model, especially in light of the kind of people who are in
attendance at a <strike>bro</strike>programmer conference…we are mostly awkward OK! So why
force us into a 30 minute “mingle tarcks” with no Internet, little
coffee, and definitely NO beer?</p>

<p>Not <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">challenging</a> yourself to meet people at conferences is a terrible way
to go through something potentially awesome. However, forcing people
into these (30 minute <a href="http://www.gamesprays.com/images/icons/icon_54.jpg">tarcks</a>) isn’t going to lead to anything
impressive. Yes, a few intermission <a href="http://sfappeal.com/alley/images/WatermelonsGoneWild.jpg">tarcks</a> are great. We as nerds should be ripped from
the confort of our <a href="http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&amp;pid=pdkb400bn">mechanical keyboards</a> and Aeron chairs and
forced to interact with other like minded fools. It is just 100% more
productive when a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Papst%20Blue%20Ribbon">lubricant</a> is involved. This could include mini
coding sessions, pairing games for future hackathons, tiny code
challenges, beer drinking, anything!</p>

<p>Keeping these times open and only for 30 minutes makes us realize how
little we can dive into a person’s life (if they even let us), before we
are ushered back to another talk. The moral? If you are starting a
conference, think long and hard about the mingle tarcks. They are
<em>invaluable</em>; however, if poorly managed, a definite: stagnant
nightmare. Be brilliant and <strong>assist</strong> in the breeding of said genius.</p>

        How To Think Like A Vimer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>SO this post isn’t going to help all of you Textmate, Textmate2,
SublimeText, emacs, or nano nerds out there. Nope, it is just for the
good ole folks who have their shit together and use the wonder that is
Vi or Vim. I haven’t written a whole lot on the subject in a while;
however, plan on something a little more <a href="http://picturesofpeoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com/">noob</a> friendly sometime soon.</p>

<p>When you pick up a piece of actual paper, you know the <a href="http://www.inhabitots.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/halloween1.jpg">scary stuff</a>
that exists in real life, do you think of how you build your sentences?
Moreover, do you think about how to navigate back through them if you
need to <a href="http://sale.images.woot.com/Illiterate_RainbowjiuDetail.png">edit</a> anything when you are finished? I am going to go out
on a limb and say that most people have never <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oByir_N-0rI/Tkaq3pX44_I/AAAAAAAAk-I/QJBS12_973o/s640/Marcus.png">expired</a> one thought
on these concepts.</p>

<p>Why? When it comes to the bulk of our verbal creation these days, we are sitting on
a computer and we need to navigate in between a myriad of
lines and words to edit whatever we are working on. If this is true, why
don’t we take the time to sit down and think of the most effective way
to get from point A to point B? Here is a test:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sit down at your computer and pull up(in your <a href="http://www.vim.org/">editor-du jour</a>)
some prose</li>
  <li>Look at how the editor structures the text, look at the line breaks,
the spacing, how many words are placed on a line, etc.</li>
  <li>Place the cursor anywhere on the page, this will be your start point</li>
  <li>Find a place that needs editing, maybe it is a misspelled word, bad
punctuation, whatever</li>
  <li>Lasty, figure out how to get there <strong>without</strong> using the mouse and
with as <strong>few keystrokes</strong> as humanly possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is how a vimer <a href="http://cdn.quotesnsayings.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Finding-Out-That-Someone-Does-The.png">does it</a>. Also I am not too sure it is “Vimer”
or “Vimmer”.</p>

        Cocks At A Conference
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>I admit it, I am kind of bad at this whole conference scene thing. I love
meeting people but most of the time they force themselves into talking
points instead of bringing things up naturaly. Of course this will
happen due to the large amount of people interacting with each other
over a short amount of time. We just aren’t that skilled, nerd or not.</p>

<p>Besides the hallway track which often turns into the simple “toot toot”, you have the random person that can’t keep their face out of their
laptop or scribbling on their iPad…Therebye, giving-up said: toot-toot factor.
Asshats basically, lots and lots of Asshats. Close that shit, get the twinky out of your mouth,
listen to the presenter and quit being a fuckup.</p>

<p>After all why on earth are you at this conference? To tick off some
imaginary box for a raise? Why are you programming? Go ahead, ask yourself that
NOW. It’s free and maybe you can write the file down on your iPad.</p>

<p>I know that I said that there would be some fun links included in these
posts. So why is this one so angry…and dry you might ask? Well for
starters I severely dislike this type of a person and this exact file
was finished from my phone at 11:45 pm tonight.</p>
