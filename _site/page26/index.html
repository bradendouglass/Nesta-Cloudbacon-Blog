    <span class="post-date">04 May 2011</span>

    <p>Ruby, Rails, and “micro-builders” like Sinatra are seeing a boon these days in
the engineering world. Just a few days ago (er last night I guess) we had a
going away party for a prominent Rails dev in town who is on their way to
<a href="www.livingsocial.com">Living Social</a>. As I was perusing through
<a href="http://www.taskrabbit.com/">taskrabbit</a> today I happened to see a rather cute
sticky note that said they are <a href="http://www.taskrabbit.com/main/careers">hiring</a>
for a senior Rails engineer with 5k as a signing bonus! And to top off all this
	hiring madness, One of my favorite rails based companies: <a href="www.engineyard.com">Engine
	Yard</a> is on the
	<a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/jobvite.aspx?b=nTGPvgwE">lookout</a> for an App
	Support Engineer with a heaping amount of Rails power.</p>

<p>The moral of all this money being thrown around the Rails community? Well, for
anyone just getting into RoR and the Ruby world, there is plenty to look
forward to. At the moment, I wish there was a way to supercharge my Rails
ability so I could fit in at one of these places. Engine Yard would be
incredible, the guys there are just plain insanely smart, Taskrabbit seems like
a great place to work in SF (although they do seem to have a lot of Biz dev
guys and gals over there), and LivingSocial is on a rocket ride with their
recent <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/the-tech-observer/2010/12/02/amazon-eyes-investment-in-living-social-as-counter-to-google-groupon-play">capital from Amazon</a>.</p>

<p>Go out there, learn some Rails and get yourself hired.</p>

        Something New and An App
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>Ok, so to be fair there hasn’t been all that much going on around here lately.
There was some obscure update about moving things away from a database type
system on to flat files yet, no further updates. Yep well, don’t get your
hearts in a tizzy because this is <em>far</em> from a formal post.</p>

<p>Some plans moving forward though are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Update the css to something far moah sexier these days, lets say
  <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a>. I write in SCSS (because it’s new bitches!),
  none of that old .sass stuff…well sometimes.</li>
  <li>Fix this home page bullshit. Maybe I will kick the blog into it’s own world
  and have some type of awesome, fairly un-ballsy welcome page for you all to
  sift through.</li>
  <li>Get <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> fired up and working. If you work your way
  back through some past articles, Disqus pops up and seems to function here
  and there…I just need to lock it down.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yep, that’s it really. Oh the app, right! The boys (and presumably girls) from
<a href="http://blog.tweetdeck.com/new-ios">Tweetdeck</a> have released a welcome update
to their iPhone app. They claim it to be a complete re-write which, take it as
you will, may or may-not be true. I spent a few minutes playing with it this
afternoon and am quite impressed. The original app wasn’t a deal breaker for
the iPhone like it was the iPad, and apparently they are on track with updating
the iPad version very soon. I wonder if they got the memo from Apple a couple
of years ago describing the universal app availability?</p>

        A Triumphant Return to Cloudbacon
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>And we are BACK!. That’s right, I haven’t really been gone, vacationing, or
really anything else more glamorous than sitting around on my duff. However,
what is really changed…again…is the blog. In less, than 2 months Cloudbacon
has migrated from <a href="www.posterous.com">Posterous</a>, to
<a href="www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, and now resides in flat text files.</p>

<p>You are absolutely wrong, wait what did you guess that we are using as a CMS
now? I would put some serious money down to deny that you guessed
<a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org">Nanoc</a>. Nanoc is actually a <a href="http://blog.guestlistapp.com/post/2304152860/five-reasons-to-use-a-static-site-generator-instead-of">static site
generator</a>
that has some nifty features baked in to provide anyone with a simple blogging
process. Why on earth would Cloudbacon make such a drastic change (from PHP to
Ruby) in the course of a Month? You asked…</p>

<ol>
  <li>No security issues: Less to be exact. MYSQL, which is <strong>STILL</strong> the only way
  to enjoy Wordpress can be somewhat unstable and prone to <a href="http://unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html">injection
  attacks</a>.</li>
  <li>Text files: Anyone who has ever met me knows how much I adore the simplicity
  apparent in text files. They are versatile, captivating, and incredibly
  small. Actually, who here doesn’t know about text files? I am not talking
  about “Word documents.” I am belaboring about those weird, little files that
  have a “txt” at the end of them. Please…take the time to do some research
  on why they kick ass.</li>
  <li>Git: Now that MYSQL has been removed from the backbone of Cloudbacon, this
  editor is now able to use Github and Git as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">revision control
  system</a>…HUZZAH! Do a little
  research here as well if you are lost.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is definitely quite a few rough edges laying around but I wanted to get a
MVB (Minimum Viable Blog) rolling and leave iteration for later. As always, the
scope of things around here won’t change too much. If you are into Apple,
beautiful code, the sexy Web, or just into community; this place should be
pretty fucking cool to hang out. For now, here is a good start to rid yourself
of that Wordpress site (I really love the guys behind Wordpress, they kick a
lot of ass).</p>

    <p><img src="http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/Color-iPhone-App.jpg" alt="Color Application Actually in Use" /></p>

<p>You probably have never heard of it but,
<a href="http://www.color.com/">Color</a> is a new photo sharing app for the
iPhone. Although it might be fairly unknown, this app has already garnished a
healthy 41 million dollars in venture capital from the fabled Valley firm:
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2011/tc20110324_504360.htm">Sequoia Captial</a>. To put that number into perspective, that is <strong>more</strong>
than Sequoia gave Google in the early days. Let’s start with what the haters
are saying and move into something more positive.</p>

<p>Uncle Leo Laporte on his fabled <a href="http://twit.tv/twit">TwiT</a> radio
show called Color a waste of money and an immediate failure.
<a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a> picked up a few pieces but, in
general was echoed out by a wonderfully large group of people on Leo’s side.
This sentiment seems to be transcending throughout the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=color+41+million&amp;tbm=blg">blogosphere</a>,
with very few positive voices squeaking through. Much of this mashing of teeth
derives from these people seeing no real value in the product, certainly not
the pro-ported 100+ million dollar evaluation.</p>

<p>At its core, Color is just another photo sharing application that is currently
stuck on the iOS platform. Its functionality might be reminiscent of
<a href="http://picplz.com/">Picplz</a> or <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a> but, this is where the
generalizations stop. The kick-ass function baked into Color is its ability to
create ad-hoc social photo networks (streams) on the fly. The application uses
the phone’s built-in GPS along with an audio key to pair users together. There
is no friending people, no you follow someone; however, just being near each
other create the essence of “following.” Pretty fucking cool.</p>

<p>I have fiddled with the app for a bit and since I live with some iPhone touting
nerds, it is easy to see the value in the technology. It is incredibly fun to
see photos taken by friends pop into the local feed. People perceive this
mostly hilarious world in such different ways and I believe this app grasps
this better than anything currently available. You are able to see what people
are focused on, what they care about, and what they think (comments are baked
in) all in real-time. It gives the user the ability to experience every
situation in a party where before he/she was trapped to what was directly in
front of him/her. Not to worry though, there are some definite rough spots.</p>

<p>Unless you live around people who have access to an iPhone you are pretty much
out of luck unless you happen to be checking the application while at the park
and pair up with random folk. It is doubtful that this pitfall will ever go
away since this is really what the entirety of the application hinges on.
Moreover and before a much-needed update, the interface was extremely bizarre.
Icons didn’t really make much sense and you had to stumble your way through the
experience until you grasped what was really going on.</p>

<p>Sure there are a few shortcomings but, the technology is new, it’s being used
in a chat application called <a href="http://yobongo.com/">Yobongo</a> and
really nothing else that I am aware of at this very moment. With the
high potential for failure(not exactly true when you have 41 million burning a
whole in your pocket) I believe that the Color team has made something truly
interesting in a sea of “meh” experiences. And let’s be honest, why the fuck
are all these “tech elites and taste makers” hating on a modicum of innovation
in the Valley? Get out from behind your ancient blogs and podcasts and make
something disruptive!</p>
