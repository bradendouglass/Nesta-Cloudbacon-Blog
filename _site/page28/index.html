    <p>Surrounding yourself with cool people should be an
integral part of your work and personal life. Your’s truly happens to be
married and still lives with people. Community kicks ass and these guys in the
Craigslist post below definitely have something special going on. Moreover,
maybe there really are some cool people in the south. Click through for a

<p>Yes, I know it is a Sunday night and there are much “cooler” things going on
like <a href="http://www.marco.org/3991237704">@Marco’s</a> <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23dickbar">#dickbar</a> post. Or
perhaps the <a href="http://gigaom.com/2011/03/20/in-att-t-mobile-merger-everybody-loses/">shit going down between AT$T and T-Mobile</a>? So why focus on something as trivial
as a bunch of overheating Macs?</p>

<p>Buying a MacBook Pro, at least for the past 5 years, and a PowerBook before
that meant that you were paying a little extra money to get your grubby mits on
a machine of potentially insane power. With this quad-core
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Macbook Pro</a> refresh, consumers have
access to amazing portable computers. However, said computers aren’t devoid of
a few serious bugs. First to appear was the <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=13143936">ominous flicker</a>
when one of Apple’s very own Apple Cinema Displays was plugged into the new
<a href="http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/">thunderbolt / mini display port</a>.
Now, people are seeing their powerhouses <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2768351">hard freeze under load</a>.</p>

<p>A bleeding-edge technology like Thunderbolt (how the fuck do you write that
btw? is it Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt port, the thunderbolt?) is bound to exhibit
some kinks but, a computer that is given an insane amount of raw processing
power (I am serious jealous and I have a first gen unibody 17 which is no
slouch) faltering when you throw something complex at it? Something definitely
is wrong. If anyone has purchased one of these little beasties and you are
experiencing some of the issues mentioned
<a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2768351">in this thread</a> you are in luck. What you may or may not realize is, you purchased
the right computer.</p>

<p>Take it back. Apple, knows these issues are occurring and will swap out your
computer or attempt to get it fixed within a few days. Some people are even
reporting a 24 hour turn around. My computer has developed an odd flicker and
because I purchased AppleCare, 2 years later I am still receiving amazing
customer service from the boys and girls at 1 Infinite Loop. These issues can
definitely be classified as “no fun” and the hard freeze issue is a
productivity sponge; however, arm yourself with a video of the issue and go see
an Apple Genius. Moreover, have fun, you spent 2k on a machine that will last a
good long time and dominate most applications during it.</p>

        Fixing MYSQL in Homebrew
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2011</span>

    <p><em>EDIT</em>: Sometimes this doesn’t happen. It seems to be a random occurrence on a random smattering of systems.</p>

<p>If you are even thinking about a career or just having some fun with software development, I recommend a handy little company named Apple and a package manager called <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>. Mac OS X (pronounced O-S 10) is basically a prettier shell of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">Unix</a>, minus all the kick ass packet managers (APT, MiKTex, YUM, etc). These “package managers” allow the user to install and uninstall applications via the terminal without having to do all that <a href="http://www.codecoffee.com/tipsforlinux/articles/27.html">make, make install bullshit</a>. I have been using Homebrew without a problem up until yesterday when I attempted to install MySQL.</p>

<p>Most people don’t need to worry about these things because there is an application called <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html">MAMP</a> that takes all the legwork out of dealing with Apache, MySQL, and PHP on your Mac. If you want something fairly robust and plan only on doing HTML, CSS, and PHP then this little application should be fine for your needs. If you decide you want to branch out into Ruby, Rails, Django, etc you might find the need to install these items via source. However, this brings me to another point. <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/">The MySQL dev page</a> has a simple .dmg that you can use to download and install MySQL on your Mac.  So wait…why on earth would I pull my hair out for six plus hours trying to get MySQL to function properly with Homebrew?</p>

<p>Homebrew creates a simple repository for all your package needs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link">symlinks</a> the files into their required locations. This makes updating packages ridiculously easy as well as installing said packages. No needing to guess if you removed all those pesky files sitting around your system. Simply type:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=brew install"></script>

<p>and you are golden. Golden until you try to grab the MySQL formula. Without further ado, let’s fire up <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/">ITerm2</a> or Terminal and get this functioning:</p>

<p>First make damn sure that /usr/local is rocking the correct permissions required by Homebrew. After a major OS X upgrade (from 10.6.5 to 10.6.6) this folder can revert back to its’ default permissions. To solve this we:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=chown"></script>

<p>NOTE: The correct snippet uses primes (`) (the mark beside the number one on a US Keyboard), not single quotes. For some reason these don’t parse well with Wordpress. This just gives you ownership under /usr/local so you don’t have to install every formula with the sudo command. Some people have “security” issues with doing this but, they are just really just crybabies. Next tell Homebrew that you really want the MySQL formula:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=brew mysql"></script>

<p>This should take some time, don’t worry. When it finishes it will regurgitate some commands to finish the installation. Here is what we need to do:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=build mysql"></script>

<p>Some people have issues with this without prepending “sudo.” If the chown -R command worked successfully, it should build all the default tables and the root user. Normally the root user is created without a password but, through this installation, the MySQL instance is actually created without any dummy tables or users (even root!). Before we go any further let’s make sure that the server is off:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=launch_ctl"></script>

<p>Next, lets force the server (mysqld) to startup regardless of permissions:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=grant-tables"></script>

<p>Now that the server is running open a separate window or tab (in Terminal/iTerm) and login to the server with:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=u root"></script>

<p>If everything worked out, you should be presented with a mysql&gt; prompt and full access to the database. Next up on the chopping block, we need to create some users. When issuing the next couple of commands the server should tell you that 0 tables were changed. Don’t fret, we aren’t changing tables, just permissions; MySQL is obligated to tell you every little thing it does…it is boring like that. In addition, all of the below is case-sensitive (For peeps who don’t work with strait MySQL queries)</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=gistfile1.sql"></script>

<p>Change the “YOUR_PASSWORD” field to whatever you like and DONE! Yep, that is it. Now you can start and stop the MySQL server at will with:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=server stop start"></script>

<p>After figuring out all of this around 3am this Sunday morning, I realized that my life is nothing but a bag of awesome-problem solving door knobs. Go forth and install MySQL not through MAMP or the dev .dmg but, through a fully featured, and sometimes broken (there will always be trade offs) package manager.</p>

<p>…<del>worst</del> best. Well nursing a food comma from lunch this afternoon,
I stumbled onto <a href="http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/03/18/professionalism-is-for-amateurs/">this post about “professionalism”</a> from the editor / owner
of <a href="http://thenextweb.com/">The Next Web</a>. The
epidemic issue underlying the idea of professionalism is the fact that people
hide behind it. They might initially think it is the correct way to act in a
business situation; however, as they evolve it becomes a shield and eventually
a crutch. I implore everyone to read the article, it is quick, easy and written
oh so much better than what I could produce. Afterward, think long and hard why
you may weight the idea of “professionalism” so highly.</p>

        Why Is Twitter Scared Again? Oh Right
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>Late last week, <a href="http://twitter.com/rsarver">Ryan Sarver</a> (head of
API and platform at Twitter) came out and announced that they would like it a
lot if developers would <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a?pli=1">focus more on stats and less on clients</a>. Many people don’t know this but,
Twitter was basically jump - started into popularity by the myriad of clients
that could access the API. In the early days, Twitter.com (
<a href="http://mettadore.com/ruby/ruby-cant-scale/">Ruby sometimes has scaling issues</a>) was so unbelievably buggy that many of us early adopters relied
heavily on these 3rd party clients just to access our tweets.</p>

<p>Now the folks at Twitter are asking these devs to stop? Something doesn’t sound
right…and here’s why! Protect and defend instead of innovate and kick ass.
Some strategy yah got there <a href="http://twitter.com/dickc">Dick</a>.</p>

<p><img src="http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/client_ss.jpeg" alt="Twitter Client Usage Pie Chart" /></p>

<p>What are the 3rd party clients you guys and gals are using or perhaps jazzed
about at the moment? Anything cool coming down the pipeline that might be
railroaded by this decision?</p>
