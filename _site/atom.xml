   <title>Webpack Hot Reload And Rails</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/05/03/webpack-rails-sprockets/"/>
   <updated>2015-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/05/03/webpack-rails-sprockets</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://webpack.github.io/&quot;&gt;Webpack&lt;/a&gt; seems to be getting plenty of lip service these days.
Doubly so in the React community which means most of Facebook.
Since Rails leans so heavily on the asset pipeline,
how can we merge ES6, modules, &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html&quot;&gt;and other bits of Webpack greatness&lt;/a&gt;
with the age old,
do one thing well: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets&quot;&gt;Sprockets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/braidn/4a11487a59f16b196fa7&quot;&gt;two scripts&lt;/a&gt; (one used for Development, the other Production),
show that Webpack can easily integrate with Rail’s existing asset pipeline.
While giving way to utilizing many of the best features hidden in Webpack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few caveats about running these scripts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The directory structure assumes a &lt;code&gt;./client&lt;/code&gt; folder,
top level in your Rails app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The common/development script assumes that assets  will be served from a server.
This means you will need a few &lt;code&gt;javascript_include_tags&lt;/code&gt; wrapped in &lt;code&gt;Rails.env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The two urls for this server are: http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server.js
and http://localhost:8080/bundle.js.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To run the Dev script: &lt;code&gt;$(npm bin)/webpack-dev-server --config webpack.config.js --hot --progress --inline --display-chunks&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And the Prod script: &lt;code&gt;$(npm bin)/webpack --config webpack.production.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Currently there is only one ‘entry point’ defined as ‘app’.
This will need to be modified depending on the entry point or bootstrap script.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Production script builds one file into the app/assets/javascripts directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Infinity Keyboard</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/04/05/infinity-keyboard-info/"/>
   <updated>2015-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/04/05/infinity-keyboard-info</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As an avid keyboardist, keyboarder… whatever. I jumped on the very first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massdrop.com/buy/infinity-keyboard-kit&quot;&gt;Inifinity Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; offered by Massdrop back in November of 2014. Having built it, played with it and attempted to program it with a missing web interface; there is definitely more than a few words on my mind. However, this post is more of an introduction to the knowledge gained throughout my time with it, instead of a true review/product breakdown. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/braidn/Knowledge-Repo&quot;&gt;GitHub houses a random collection of markdown files&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/braidn/Knowledge-Repo/blob/master/InfinityKllInfo.md&quot;&gt;One specifically&lt;/a&gt; highlights ways to build/config/customize the Infinity’s layouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this helps folks out who are struggling with the seeming lack of information surrounding this obscure but, somewhat interesting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.overleaf.com/read/zzqbdwqjfwwf&quot;&gt;way to define keyboard layouts&lt;/a&gt;. If for any reason you happen to want to add or correct anything, feel free to open a GitHub issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing: There seems to be a lot of talk surrounding the bounce/debounce rate of these boards. Some of them seem to exibit double key presses from one single keypress. While this is a configurable option in the KLL files, it should not be a need if the board was properly soldered. A very easy fix is to flux/solder the connections up with quality 60/40 rosin core solder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;update-2015-04-12&quot;&gt;Update 2015-04-12&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have finally compiled all of the build scripts into one KLL based directory that could be wrapped in Git. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/braidn/infinity&quot;&gt;Git repo is, as always on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and everyone should fork it if they are looking for a quick way to bootstrap their Infinity based Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the awesome folks at Massdrop have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.massdrop.com/buy/infinity-ergodox&quot;&gt;released an ErgoDox keyboard&lt;/a&gt; variant that will be powered by the same configurator/keyboard mapping language. The great thing about these keyboards using the same controller is only needing to have one &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ojbucao/workman&quot;&gt;workman-p mapping&lt;/a&gt; that can be flashed to different keyboards. Which means, although I own and adore my now gen1 ErgoDox, I will definetly be picking up the new version. Likely with stiffer, Cherry MX Tactile Greys.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Problem Solving In Golang</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/03/20/debugging-on-go/"/>
   <updated>2015-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/03/20/debugging-on-go</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nope, not actually problem solving because that is in fact boring, something that no one is really interested in and somewhat of a non starter. Doubley so when things haven’t been updated much around here. Go or GoLang is a fantastic language at hunting down problems, or what some would call “debugging”. I would call it debugging as well however, I am sure there are a myriad of words that all mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever a Go program comes under the green light, the developer uses the handy &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; command. This kicks off the compile step inheret in Go programming; and, since this is in fact programming, there will be errors.  These errors are accompanied by a somewhat small stacktrace (thank you Rob) along with the line number where the offense is occurring. The greatest thing is that these exceptions are small, readable (by humans) and consise.  A programmer with little information on the language mechanics can read: “no method x exists for x” and realize they likely lower cased the first character of the method’s name. Or perhaps they should just look back through through the documentation one more time to see where they took the incorrect turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALSO! Captial methods… Good one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, a Luddite as myself can figure out what is going on in a language that I am actively learning and feel satisfied. No stacktraces where you have to increase the lines recorded in Tmux. Just a few lines… For humans.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Javascript For A Week</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/01/24/js-for-a-week/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/01/24/js-for-a-week</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;js-for-a-week&quot;&gt;JS For A Week&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the better part of 5 years I have been writing,
hacking and generally focused on the Ruby programming language.
This hasn’t stopped me from exploring other languages; however,
besides a small and rather painful stint writing PHP (again),
many days were spent crafting Ruby code.
In addition to this,
the last 2 years has been spent ping-ponging between different code bases.
Not so much over the course of the past week.
Yep, all of it was spent writing purely Javascript and without the help of Coffee
and all for a single product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-was-learned&quot;&gt;What was learned&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best thing to do after a dicotomy of a situation like this
is to perform a bit of introspection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-it-was-hard&quot;&gt;Why it was hard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Why it differs so greatly from Ruby
## What was the takeway&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2014 Year In</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/01/10/2014-year-in-review/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2015/01/10/2014-year-in-review</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This seems to be the normal kind of thing these days. Write a year in review, reflect, generate some add dollars, and keep the Internet fixated on your blog long enough to seem somewhat relevant through to 2016. Without messing with the end of your weekend, or getting in the way of your new found reading skills (zing, nope) let’s begin what will only be, potentially, the most exhilarating year in review… Well until next year that is. Oh, yeah. One more thing: If for some unholy reason you need to pull a TLDR, skip to the end. Predictions for 2015 are abound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-work-is-important&quot;&gt;Why work is important.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work should be a rather large influence in life. We spend nearly 8 hours toiling away at it for five days strait. Some, well most of us spend even more time at it. The uneducated few, often times say this is due to our in-ability to produce results or that we are slow or unproductive. However, 99% of these people are incorrect. Most of us spend extra time at work honing our skills or appealing to customers because we, the 99%, actually adore their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am no different, I love every aspect of building the digital world. From creating elaborate hoax interfaces(much like the redesign around here) to intricate message passing, semi pure OOP style backends to pass data around, and even a little API style development here and there. Since there is so much overlap with work/play life, this is a great place to look at what was shipped in 2014:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;list-of-accomplishments&quot;&gt;List of accomplishments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first and by far the largest is breaking ground on 3 new projects. The general Ruby smell was there, underpinning the backend; however, there was a ton of learning on the front-end. React, Angular(which I am still skeptical about) and a heavy smattering of Backbone rounded out the Javascript libraries and frameworks. These new projects involved upgrading Spree, maintaining and improving test coverage, feature implementation and a general heap of awesome, fairly well written code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side project completion was up dramatically in 2014. Where side projects usually became just another repository tick box in GitHub, 2014 changed that in a large way. EmailGrouper(name still in transition) was thought up, created, implemented in the summer of 2014. Then, during a tumultuous fall, was rewritten from pojo style JS to Ruby utilizing Rails. Although perhaps not the most sexy thing in the world, this app was a great test bed for learning the ins-and-outs of MiniTest, along with creating a more vanilla Rails experience over the normal Spree inspired store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for some accomplishments that definitely fit within the realm of work but might not be so code based:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I visited the team at Dynamo(my home) four times over the course of the year. One time spending nearly a month in the wonderful city that is Montreal. Canada is much different than the States, doubly so since Montreal is in the French, Québec quarter. Language aside, everyone is just a smidgen more friendly, more out going, more open, and without a doubt more fit. Anyone who is on a remote team(it is pretty fucking epic, I highly recommend it) should have a goal to see their team and especially, hug them on a quarterly basis(as the very minimum). Visiting semi-often has lead to better team dynamics, understanding of how everyone works, and best of all: Meeting significant others, children, families, and figuring out who in the office can drink you under the table. Due to their “Canadian-ness” that would be every single one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the unfortunate news, the stuff that may have been missed in 2014. For starters the goal of learning a language every year, as highlighted by the boys behind &lt;em&gt;The Pragmatic Programmer&lt;/em&gt; sort of fell by the wayside. Sure, technically I learned two languages: GoLang and Rust. Both were more of a skim than an actual learn. The duties of work really usurped my programming time and dealing with other co-founders in a startup equated to even less time. Besides this though, and maybe missing a few months where I planned to run through a whole Field Notes book during the month, goal completion and expectations for work were met right around the 100% figure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;goal-related&quot;&gt;Goal Related&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of goals. 2014 was perhaps the first time in history where all the goals that were planned out for the year were stuffed into OmniFocus and reviewed on a weekly basis. This brings a somewhat silly concept (goals in general) top of mind every Saturday and Sunday. They are played out in an “in your face” style and one can hardly complain that a goal was forgotten when a review like this is so frequent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of 2014’s goals centered around being a better team member, as highlighted above, visiting the office on more specific intervals, reading and writing more, focusing on my marriage, and a smattering of strength goals. All 14, two per quarter, half and full year were accomplished. Small things like using the plethora of Field Notes to actually take notes, purchasing new and much needed clothes, and getting 135 pounds over my head in a specific manner. Overall, 2014 was a great year for goals, and the setup for 2015 looks twice as ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;personal-related&quot;&gt;Personal Related&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, and by far the least are the personal accomplishments throughout the year. 2014 was another bombshell year for these. The wife and I hit a large home run by actually buying a house together. Sure it is small, and perhaps a little too cold for her liking in the winter but, it fits us nicely and doesn’t take two days to just clean the bathrooms. Seriously, large houses suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the house and the remote job came a much needed office upgrade. My first, and likely last proper standing desk was purchased along with a few other items to make my life a little easier while staying home all day. Other things include, new couches, ridding the area around the house of termites using only “natural” means and other such homely, somewhat boring accomplishments. In addition to the home, we planned and executed on a fun vacation to Colombia early in 2015 and took a trip that was based solely on exploration to Colorado in early December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength is a big thing in my life at the moment and although I had some major shoulder surgery just two years ago, the rebound has been slow but, gratifying. 2014 marked my ability to properly sit at the very bottom of a Snatch without a gigantic amount of pain. This quickly lead me to being able to perform handstand pushups which I have never been able to accomplish. In addition, some of the better numbers throughout the year include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;505 lb Deadlift&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;515 lb JLift&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;245 lb High Hang Clean&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;295 lb Zercher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life in 2014 was definitely not the easiest but, it did give way to some fun accomplishments that were pretty integral in living a much more meaningful and purpose driven life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;predictions-for-2015&quot;&gt;Predictions for 2015&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aww, the best part of these 2014 in review posts: predictions! That, and all the awesome sponsor money these posts accrue… anyway. My best guess is this year is going to be epic although, not so much in the tech realm. The introduction of the iWatch and all of the wearable technology will somewhat diminish the already existing awesome sauce infused infrastructure we have. Sure wearables will make a dent in the marketplace, but their adoption will be slow and somewhat rife with pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of technology, perhaps the underground part or the slow tech movement(is that still a thing?) will make an interesting comeback. Offline first application development will see a much higher rise in usage leading to web based applications having a much better chance against their native counterparts. Web components, the ones seen in React will aid in the creation of better documented, easier to work on, “native-er” UI’s overall. Due to this, the larger frameworks out there like Angular and Ember are going to have to come to terms with their size and the overall load they cause on these smaller devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of devices in general. Phones will continue to grow, disproportionate to our ear sizes. The usage and need of Phablet’s was legitimized this year with the iPhone 6+’s break out home run by Apple. Google quickly followed suite with the Nexus 6 and while we will not likely see many bigger phones in 2015, there will be many more “large phone” options. Maybe I am getting a bit older, and my eyesight just isn’t what it was when I was young but, staring at a minuscule iWatch screen holds no interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for a few Dark Horses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;.Net will realize the foolishness of their ways and force every .Net developer to return to the far superior Classic ASP.
Selfie, the word will be eradicated from the language ergo allowing us to control our facial features again without the aid of seeing them. That and the famous selfie stick will see more widespread banning.
Apple Pay/Google Wallet will basically eradicate the reason to carry around physical credit cards. In places where cash is still king… cash will remain the dominant player. Items like Coin, etc are already obsolete, only the early adopters will use or buy them. In addition, the ridiculous text fields that house credit card numbers online will also become moot. Thereby allowing a cognitive sigh of relief for anyone who has thought of more secure or quicker ways to take people’s money online.
Google will relent in their quest to own everyone’s email data and sunset the Gmail service. Thereby removing any major player in the space using Dart and force everyone to find a new, more secure, less ad driven email client.
Microsoft will release a new browser that uses the Blink rendering engine and will be the first release since IE7 to run natively on a Mac. No one will use it but, everyone will have to figure out how to support it in 3 years when they jump ship to Gecko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can only hope.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Slack ZNC and IRC Meet For A Shootoff</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/11/02/slack-minus-the-interruptions/"/>
   <updated>2014-11-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/11/02/slack-minus-the-interruptions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Feel free to raise your hand every time you log into the web interface for Slack (you know, the messaging app &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-raises-120-million-2014-10&quot;&gt;everyone is flinging money at&lt;/a&gt;, seriously does anyone remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glitchthegame.com/&quot;&gt;Glitch&lt;/a&gt;?) and are automagically angered by the battering of annoyances that surround “Notifications.” Yes, notifications, those pesky little fuckers that &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/kife&quot;&gt;kife&lt;/a&gt; your time and feed that growing portion of lizard brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slack is great for team communications however, can easily become a bear to manage, even through their plethora of keyboard shortcuts. If you, like myself love the team I work for but, don’t want to just shut them out for a large amount of the day, what are the options? Glad you didn’t ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last three weeks… or so. What day of June is it? I have been using, chatting, consuming Slack through its’ IRC Gateway. As it happens, I mentioned the word IRC to a fellow developer yesterday and he was surprised it was still around. Yes, yes IRC is still around and for many of us in the programming community, it is the defacto way to communicate with our peers. However, there is one problem with IRC that has plagued it for quite some time. When you aren’t logged in you miss all of the juicy cat gifs everyone is sharing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great solution for this came about several years ago (it’s still 2005 right?) called &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC&quot;&gt;ZNC&lt;/a&gt;. ZNC is a bouncer that sits around in all of your connected IRC rooms and servers (Slack included) and captures what everyone is saying. Once you connect back to ZNC with a client like the newly and brilliantly updated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeux.com/textual/&quot;&gt;Textual 5&lt;/a&gt;, ZNC will read back to you what you missed and when it was typed. Pretty fucking sweet! So how do we tie all of this together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing is first we are assuming that ZNC is all set up and an Admin user is available. If this hasn’t occurred yet, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-znc-an-irc-bouncer-on-an-ubuntu-vps&quot;&gt;this guide does a wonderful job&lt;/a&gt;. I recommend creating a new user for each Slack gateway (an admin might have to activate this if you are just a mere peon). In addition, you will want to keep your nick as the user outlined in your Slack’s gateway settings and your bind-host to: 0.0.0.0. The bind-host thing is odd, it’s Slack being persnickety, just need to deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a login for ZNC, we need to add a server to this user. The easiest way to do this is to add a server to Textual5, and login using the &lt;strong&gt;ZNC&lt;/strong&gt; credentials for your Slack user. Once signed in, you won’t be connected to Slack however, you should msg help to /*status for a list of commands. One of these commands will be for adding a server which takes 3 arguments:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The url of the Slack gateway. Again, this is found on the specific gateway settings page for each organization.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The port, which in this case is 6667&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A password which is your specific Slack IRC password. This is different than the normal Slack password. Again, grab this from your gateway specific settings page on Slack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All connections to Slack servers should be done so over a secure or SSL connection (why won’t you think of the children). When adding the server, make certain to add a plus sign(&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;) immediately before the port (no spaces). Simply disconnect and reconnect to the ZNC server and BOOM! All of your rooms will show up as well as any private rooms that you are apart of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have logged off for a while or over night, the moment you log back in, ZNC will read back what you missed. Success! Slack integrations also show up in rooms as well! This is is a double success if a team relies on GitHub commits or their CI status. Overall I like being able to choose my own consumption point for Slack. It frees me up to control the notifications in a way that works for me… without annoying me insensately. For the mobile experience, I recommend a combination of email alerts for missed mentions, ZNC and &lt;a href=&quot;http://palaverapp.com/&quot;&gt;Palaver&lt;/a&gt;(there may be some marvelous IRC app for Android out there… nah, I doubt it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one of these points doesn’t seem to work for you or you get stuck feel free to reach out to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/braidn&quot;&gt;me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and we can get it fixed ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Prose.io Tweaks</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/10/12/all-prose-for-you/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/10/12/all-prose-for-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://prose.io/#about&quot;&gt;Prose.io&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best ways to interact with markdown-style form blog content. It has allowing me to write on the web, commit to GitHub and have cloudbacon run its tests ( yes it is a blog but, yes I am a programmer so most of my shit has tests ), and auto deploy to Heroku. Recently however, I have wanted to streamline this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prose gives you the ability to define specific metadata attributes that are editable in the sidebar. In addition, and really what I was looking for, it gives the user the ability to only allow one directory to be editable. This is awesome because it shows the user this very directory instead of forcing them to dig their way into a directory hierarchy to find their blog content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado: the following &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/braidn/f82fd63ac00955eeaeb3&quot;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt; is what cloudbacon is rocking. Pay special attention to the naming of the file if you don’t use &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; ( the underscore is required ).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Compilation Starts With A 'C'</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/10/07/compilation-is-for-hard/"/>
   <updated>2014-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/10/07/compilation-is-for-hard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this might be a rather simple statement, mainly because the word Compilation really truly starts with the letter: ‘c’. However, the idea also extends to the C language.  Anytime a C program is built and sent off to its consumers there is a semi-complicated, definitely fiddly make/build process. This is what defines a compiled language like C or &lt;a href=&quot;https://golang.org/&quot;&gt;Golang&lt;/a&gt; from there interpreted brethren. An example of some interpreted languages would be the following: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/forth/forth.html&quot;&gt;Forth&lt;/a&gt;. Is there an actual Forth “official” website? If for some reason you are human, and don’t quite “grok” what Forth is, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cstruter.com/articles/article/1/4&quot;&gt;this is a pretty good explanation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why on earth is this worth another blog post? There exists an awash of blog posts, Quora answers and miles of Wikipedia edits concerning these topics. Glad you asked. All of this hoopla can be summed up in this one &lt;a href=&quot;http://harpjs.com/&quot;&gt;exciting NPM module called Harp&lt;/a&gt;. Harp, if you read their website, is an exciting &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/davatron5000/2254924&quot;&gt;static site blogging tool&lt;/a&gt; that will save you all the trouble of running one of those WordPress things. Which, if you read and listen to much of the Internet (no worries, it is chill you &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2011-12-19-People-Can-Not-Read&quot;&gt;likely choose not to read&lt;/a&gt;), is like running a third world country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Harp thing… It looks pretty sweet, it even runs on Javascript which is not named even after a language that isn’t compiled. However, if one were to scroll 7/12ths down the page (yes we are succinct here), it would appear that this is “compiled”. Compiled you might ask (if you chose to read). That seems weird, why would we need to compile things like HTML/CSS when the last time anyone checked, these things could be considered ‘web native’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any rational person at this point would be all like: WTF? &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/FHWMO.gif&quot;&gt;Node Javascript&lt;/a&gt; is like a whole server? Eh? There are even frameworks that rhyme with Rails that work on this very same platform. So why would we have to compile our static files, or site, or whatever when this can be done directly on the server? Oh, because you need to compile locally and then commit your compiled code (because that makes sense). Unless of course you just wanted to take the folder that is generated by this compilation and FTP (sorry SFTP) it to your server. All of this makes sense in 2002 but, rarely could be considered a standard in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could this get any better you maybe asking? Well you could write all of your HTML in smaller, completely unmanageable chunks because only 50 out of every 328 web developers understands &lt;a href=&quot;http://jade-lang.com/&quot;&gt;Jade&lt;/a&gt; enough to juggle where they are currently in that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/a&gt; field of hell.. But, no worries, Jade is way less fiddly because you don’t have all of those brackets (shit, that’s why I love HAML and SLIM because writing inline tags is a breeze and expected output is at an all time high). Except, when you want to include someone in the project who has no idea about Jade and tries to modify the compiled source because it just makes sense… to every web developer. Then we have trouble. Though now, how do you compile the compiled source? Yeah I don’t know either. Presumably, and this is almost always a likely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‘Because I am not smart enough.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so there are quite a few glaring issues with compiling things when the runtime is actually a perfectly good server. However, there must be some reasons for these kind of static site generators? Sure! Pet projects, quick one offs, LaunchRock style landing pages and personal blogs are perfect use cases. However, due to the technical knowledge required for bringing new team members up to speed, their reliance on committing compiled code to the VCS repository, and their somewhat beta 0.0.1-ness these should remain within the personal realm. Also, having to wait for someone to return from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big&quot;&gt;their lunch break&lt;/a&gt; just to get something compiled must be a boon for the entire teams velocity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-october-6&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Goodbye Bloated Fellow</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/08/03/letting-go-of-rspec/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/08/03/letting-go-of-rspec</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.everlane.com/&quot;&gt;Monkey patching&lt;/a&gt; has been a common thing in all Ruby libraries over the years. One of the largest of them being Rspec. We all know, and love Rspec, unless of course you are a member of the Rails Core Team. Yet, with the recent release of Rspec and its’ 17 gems Rspec has given me a bad funk, that I just can’t seem to dispel. Recently, I had the chance to create a quick &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&quot;&gt;SPA&lt;/a&gt; and decided to throw Rspec out in favor of Minitest. Especially the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-rails&quot;&gt;minitest-rails&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blowmage&quot;&gt;Mike Moore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the diminutive, and quick nature of the “application”, my current usage of Minitest has been slim. However, it was just installed in a new side project and hopefully I will be able to integrate it with any new or upcoming projects. It’s small, fun, and fast. Sure I introduce several other gems that add an element of monkey patching to the equation. Although, over-all I don’t miss anything about Rspec’s seeming bloat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with a whiff of arrogance, and smattering of bias go forth and give it a whirl. Oh! And here are some sensible defaults that I feel make the transition process a little more upbeat. Also you can find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/braidn/b713c87758b3d62c4002&quot;&gt;public gist of this jazz here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Photography</title>

   <updated>2014-06-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/06/29/on-slowing-down</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At one time or another, there was an attempt in my life to be a bit of a photographer. A cool, Canon DSLR sat in my hands from when college finished into the latter years of my 20’s. For some reason, there was always a form of hesitation to take it out of it’s case and snap pictures. Even when my wife and I lived in the splendor that is Jackson Wyoming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the camera was given to my mother in law. She seemed to have the tenacity to pull it out and snap pictures far more often than I ever exhibited. Lately though there has been an intense burning to get back into some form of photography. Now though, I don’t want there to be a need to find new lenses, to build a base of items. No, just a simple camera, that takes stunning photos and is there to capture life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what is pulling me towards photography as a whole. The idea of capture. It is slow, deliberate and most often times an utter failure. The idea is that it will slow life down, make it seem more real and less of a blur. This in itself is hard to do and I would personally love to hear from anyone, photographer or not, how they calm down this ever-present blur of life.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/06/08/did-you-miss-me</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently things have been fairly spartan around here. This isn’t your fault as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2011-12-19-People-Can-Not-Read&quot;&gt;avid reader&lt;/a&gt; but, more of time spent upping my skills at what can now only be dubbed &lt;a href=&quot;http://confreaks.com/videos/3315-railsconf-keynote-writing-software&quot;&gt;‘computer writing’&lt;/a&gt;. Also buying a home, moving, visiting friends and generally being as normal of a person as possible in my shoes might have a little to do with the absence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of all that hoopla, there are tentative plans to do a 350 word, 30 day writing sprint coming up soon. All these pro-ported items will be collected right here (&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50730705aac422613b000001/big&quot;&gt;don’t fret&lt;/a&gt;).

While you are there, I highly recommend reading the other posts… because they are written by folks much smarter than this guy.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>AppSignal And Cloud66 Deploys</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/04/14/appsignal-deploy-notifications-cloud66/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/04/14/appsignal-deploy-notifications-cloud66</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Peter Berkenbosch wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;http://peterberkenbosch.nl/appsignal-deploy-notification-with-cloud66-deploy-hook/&quot;&gt;interesting piece&lt;/a&gt; on how to notify &lt;a href=&quot;https://appsignal.com&quot;&gt;AppSignal&lt;/a&gt; that your code has had a successful deploy from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloud66.com&quot;&gt;Cloud66&lt;/a&gt;. This is a somewhat understated need by the folks at AppSignal. Errors from a deployed application are actually tallied up for each deploy. Meaning if never notified of different or subsequent deploys, AppSignal will shelve everything under 1 deploy. UI wise this is a bit of a shit show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Peter’s shell command is nice, it’s a bit verbose and I have had some issues accessing &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; while in the deploy directory. That’s why I built this script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/braidn/10652341.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s a little long (much longer that &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width&quot;&gt;80c&lt;/a&gt;), it uses Git log which we have easy access to in any Git repo. In no way am I saying that this script trumps Peters; it just happens to be different. Marry this to the &lt;code&gt;deploy_hooks.yml&lt;/code&gt; example in Peter’s post and you will be quickly alerting AppSignal every time there is a deploy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big&quot;&gt;Magik&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Long Troll</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/02/22/the-long-troll/"/>
   <updated>2014-02-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/02/22/the-long-troll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One off Interent trolling isn’t anything new, nor is it something that could be construed as hard. Someone jumps into a conversation, drops a bombshell and walks away. They never have to feel the consequenses or even play a second hand. They are in and out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;long troll&lt;/em&gt; is where someone enters the conversation, slightly alters the direction and then continues to repeat the cycle. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LocalHouseBar/status/437286354196508672&quot;&gt;Perhaps the original recipient intended something to be both informative and marketable&lt;/a&gt;. However, your mind warped their intentions into something that was not only extremely giggleable but, something that you can continue to giggle at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about long trolling is the likelyhood that both parties win. The original person doesn’t feel slighted, in fact, they often feel overwhelmed that someone on the Internet is talking directly to them. Moreover, the trolling party get’s their giggles and remains the smug human they think they are. Just remember, long trolls are your friends, and quick trolls or “trolls” are just dicks.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pencils, Like Panthers</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/01/02/Where-Your-Pencil-At/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2014/01/02/Where-Your-Pencil-At</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pencils are the panthers of the creative world (that’s right, I said it). They silently lay there until something brilliant passes by. They are often overlooked for their ink staining brethren and even subject to extreme prejudice through insane feats of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pencilrevolution.com/2005/12/russian-space-pen/&quot;&gt;over-engineering&lt;/a&gt;.” However any &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad)&quot;&gt;sane man&lt;/a&gt; would agree, that the pencil is one of the most most interesting avenues to pull the scribbles of creativity from your brain to paper. I have even &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-29-A-Programmer-Journal&quot;&gt;mentioned them several times&lt;/a&gt; here on this blrrg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem inherent in pencils is that there are two damn many of them leading to a complete &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/Pencils/ct/1319&quot;&gt;paralysis of choice&lt;/a&gt;. Do you pick up a simple number 2 wooden pencil, attempt to find an original Blackwing, or go fore a more complicated drafting pencil? After quite an exhaustive search for the perfect one, I have found myself with these three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.projectno8.com/products/drafting-pencil-green?category=274&quot;&gt;Furst 2.0MM Clutch Drafting Pencil&lt;/a&gt;: This is hands down my favorite pencil and deserving of the first place on this list. It is well crafted, sturdy and can be disassembled, cleaned and reassembled with ease. Being a smaller pencil (half size) this isn’t a pencil for someone who has “manly hands.” However, paired with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Lead-Holder-Refill-2-mm-B-Pack-of-6/pd/1577&quot;&gt;good B lead&lt;/a&gt;, the results are impossible to get from any other pencil. With it’s weighted feel and smooth clutch action, this pencil is well worth the 10 dollars.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pentel.com/store/sharp-kerry-mechanical-pencil&quot;&gt;.5 mm Pentel Kerry&lt;/a&gt;: The Kerry was and is likely to ever be one of the most expensive pencils that I have ever purchased. However, it is often times difficult to find a mechanical pencil that doesn’t consistently stab the user while being toted around in their pocket. This pencil, paired with it’s great weight distribution and capped design, makes it the pencil that I carry with me whenever I leave the house. Since it also takes standard, .5 mm lead, the barrel can hold a good amount of the tiny slivers meaning that it is unlikely you will be left high and dry anytime soon.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/&quot;&gt;Field Notes Pencil&lt;/a&gt;: With my love for Field Notes, it should be  somewhat of a surprise that it took me as long as it did to warm up to these. Especially since, everyone gets one when they purchase a pack directly from Field Notes. These tend to compliment the mechanical Furst. When I need a whiff of real wood and the size of a real pencil, there is one of these within reach at all times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: every good engineer has an unequivocal, perhaps even irrational love of their favorite pencil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/528bbed3aac422ce02000015/big&quot;&gt;happy fucking 2014, hugs for everyone&lt;/a&gt;. Do us a favour and update your copywright footers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2013-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/12/29/Dream-Clients-For-2014</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you work in ecommerce, especially for a company that focuses on producing great ecommerce experiences, you &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; of working with certain clients. Perhaps they offer items that you are emotionally attached to, or it’s their corporate outlook towards their brand, or perhaps they directly influenced your childhood. Regardless, you constantly critique what they currently offer and pine to open up the web inspector in an attempt to improve your experience. You hyopthesize changes to their checkout flow or even write better and more convincing abandoned cart emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me in 2014, this “dream client” would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.filson.com/&quot;&gt;Filson&lt;/a&gt;. Sure I grew up in L.L.Bean’s back door but, Filson’s collection built from tin cloth, wool, and leather materials in combination with their old school, rustic charm make it one of the finest outdoor clothing manufactures. Here’s to hoping.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Staging Your Personal SS</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/11/20/Your-Own-Personal-Shit-Show/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/11/20/Your-Own-Personal-Shit-Show</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So much has happened since August and now. It is so actually incomprehensible
that I will leave my readership, what’s left of it to only wonder. Perhaps the
absence has actually ran all the readers, who in fact can’t read off and some
qualtity ones have returned. Alas, it is doubtful since the state of boredom
in America is &lt;a href=&quot;http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304243904579200142398477748&quot;&gt;staggering these days&lt;/a&gt;. Yep, we are so tired of stairing at our iPads we have resorted
to writing articles on chewing food. Sorry if the following doesn’t trump that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been thinking considerably about the need, and use of staging
branches. No, not servers, just the branches. Often times mine is in a state
of &lt;code&gt;reset --hard&lt;/code&gt; disaray. The reflog reflects the final 100 pages in Umberto’s
freebasing masterpiece &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Island-Day-Before-Umberto/dp/0156030373/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1385003384&amp;amp;sr=8-14&amp;amp;keywords=umberto+eco&quot;&gt;The Island Of The Day Before&lt;/a&gt; (there is a good reason
why the audio cassette can be picked up for 1 cent). To top it all off? This
branch rarely-if-ever gets synced with GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where many purest string me up and make finely cured meat out of me.
Moreover, myself 1-2 years ago would have been right with them. However, now I simply
see no point in it. Staging is as tumultuous as this &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/78124534&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; or at best, the way
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/722.html&quot;&gt;Douglass Adams describes the meaning of ‘life’&lt;/a&gt;. Staging, an active staging, is in
constant flux, never complete, always on the move. Due to all of this, keeping it
in sync seems like a foolish persuit. Maybe I am missing something? If so shoot me
a message &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/braidn&quot;&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and make sure it is full of witty expletives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also on a much bigger note, watch out for other, somewhat better written (I think
there might even be editors involved) articles over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dynalog.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Dynamo’s new bluurrrg&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s guarenteed to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502bb36faac4221844000002/big&quot;&gt;600%&lt;/a&gt; better than this has ever been… Even when
this place was owned by the Swedish Anti-Powerpoint party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/528bbed3aac422ce02000015/big&quot;&gt;Be safe, be seen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Writing Better Specs</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/08/06/Writing-Better-Features-Series/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/08/06/Writing-Better-Features-Series</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having had the pleasure to get back into Ruby and subsequently the “Rails Stack”,
I am now writing a lot more tests. For many people this tends to be a bad thing
but, I find it one of the best ways to write any type of software. In addition,
you sometimes need to explain to a designer why a specific interaction needs to
occur. These guys/gals usually have a “cool story bro” mentality about them and since they
are often awash with color palettes, they sometimes “gloss” over specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be a series of &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html&quot;&gt;features&lt;/a&gt; that are used to explain interactions in
my current work. Ready? Set-GO!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Say I am like: oh, crap, I forgot my oldest kid. Mostly because they are rambunctious and
spend a lot of money but, mainly because they were a mistake. Regardless, I sign back
into the application to add him but, because I am on my 4th Ardbeg Old Fashion of the
night (the kids drove me to this) I am all shaky and mistype my password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I call it starry, forgotten night.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Knowing Where You Suck</title>

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/07/14/concerning-suckage</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having just gotten off the “Skype-phone” with a fairly laid-back interviewer, I realized I get jittery in interviews.
By jittery, I don’t mean I start to sweat profusely and mumble like a beaten school child but, more along
the lines of: deer in headlights. And the kicker? The question wasn’t all that hard, perhaps even a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://gph.is/13mVrQo&quot;&gt;soft ball&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is new in Rails 4?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could of said: Dali cache digest, Russian doll caching, pSQL arrays, turbolinks, or PATCH but, NO!
All that could eke out of my mouth was “Parameters in the Controller vs the Model”. Which &lt;a href=&quot;http://gph.is/17ACno9&quot;&gt;doesn’t even make
a lot of sense&lt;/a&gt;. So as the folks at Thoughbot say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;you need to know your weaknesses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;mine happens to be headlights…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Of Startups and Glue</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/07/11/on-startups-and-glue/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/07/11/on-startups-and-glue</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If there was just one third party app that I was allowed to install on
any computer, it would be, without a doubt: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It isn’t particularly sexy,
nor cheap, not even easy to use but, what it does have is glue. Alfred, for one
price, for one app and for one learning curve will glue all of the disparate
parts of your &lt;a href=&quot;http://mac.appstorm.net/general/weekly-poll/weekly-poll-how-do-you-pronounce-mac-os-x/&quot;&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt; (that poll is filled with wrong) into one, quick to
fire, application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t particularly interesting, nor is it all that new on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gph.is/12bePRT&quot;&gt;know-thy-shit&lt;/a&gt;
scale-o-meter. However, for some reason this concept of “glue” is still a mystery
in the world of startups. Let’s start this part of the “conversation” off with
a simple question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What is a startup?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s ask &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt;. I am fairly sure he knows a thing or two &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/growth.html&quot;&gt;about the
subject&lt;/a&gt;. Repeatedly, Paul &lt;a href=&quot;http://kottke.org/12/09/a-startup-is-a-company-designed-to-grow-fast&quot;&gt;cites&lt;/a&gt; a startup as a “fast or rapid growing company”.
Ok, well that was easy. Just build a company that can quickly accelerate itself
to scale and boom! Startup born…or sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like velocity as a better measurement over speed. Velocity includes direction,
which tends to be a good thing for a startup. How rapid does a startup need to
iterate and build to achieve optimal velocity in hopes of a margin of success?
This question is hopelessly difficult to answer and in a roundabout way, we will look
at some things that one should do to potentially succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gph.is/14kwio&quot;&gt;glue comes in&lt;/a&gt;. If two businesses need to build an identical feature and
business1 implements an existing, mostly free API and takes 30 minutes vs business2
who implement their own solution, who wins? Perhaps business2 wants to control their own
‘stuff’ or were just naive to the fact that the API exists. Regardless, they wind
up blowing 3-4 hours of development time between two different developers. In addition
they create a considerable amount of technical debt through little documentation
and poorly architected “home grown ideas”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which business in the above scenario &lt;a href=&quot;http://gph.is/VxnVpe&quot;&gt;falls&lt;/a&gt; more inline with Paul’s “fast or rapid
growing company”? What happens then if business2 continues to think and implemnet
features in the same fashion? Business1 is solving real problems that pertain
to their business, while business2 is continuing to spin its wheels building
things that are currently, vastly-better designed. Where is the velocity or glue
in that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web is absolutely busting at the seams with all of these little services
and APIs. What is holding you back from creating a viable buisness with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/services/api/&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest&quot;&gt;Twilio&lt;/a&gt;? Just like mashups seem to be dominating the music
world, we will begin to see smarter and smarter people building successful business
using different services from around the web. Moreover, those folks who continue to ignore
them will become less and less reliable and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were an investor or perhaps just a bystander, which business described
above would you put your money in? The one that understands the value of building
fast and smart or the one that plods along and plays it safe? My bet is on the
former but, then again I do tend to pronounce it “OS Ten” (click on the links).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a reaction? Reach out to me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/braidn&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and lets have a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/04/20/Convention-V-Configuration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Convention VS Configuration is a big deal in the Rails Community. So large in fact,
some might say it dictates the entirety of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails&quot;&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt;.
This is a classic example of what the term “Convention VS Configuration” or
“Convention over Configuration” stands for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coderwall.com/p/oqtj8w&quot;&gt;The single most useful thing in bash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am always up for a good bit of trolling but, this “Coderwall” seems to really
be behind the statement (goes on to explain what the command is doing). Why not
just use &lt;a href=&quot;http://ridiculousfish.com/shell/&quot;&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a quick aside, anyone who uses the term ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linkedin.com/in/juderobinson&quot;&gt;poodling&lt;/a&gt;’ on their ‘resume’ is ok
in my book!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/03/07/Custom-Code</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It happens to be Thursday which, unbeknownst to me, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;highly speculative&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, I received some feedback on “something” this week that made me chuckle. Being a fairly normal developer, the moment chuckling gets in the mix, I head strait to Github for a venting session. Feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bradendouglass/5114104&quot;&gt;take these two files of code&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bradendouglass/5114104#file-completely_fucking_custom_controller-rb&quot;&gt;first controller&lt;/a&gt; in the gist is something that I wrote from the ground up. Every instance variable, hand crafted and exuding an amount of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/503258b5aac422d76f000036/big&quot;&gt;love and care&lt;/a&gt; that is frankly, so fucking “pornograpic” in nature you might get fired if you glance upon it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/bradendouglass/5114104#file-not_fucking_customs_controller-rb&quot;&gt;second controller&lt;/a&gt; is an absolute pile of generated trash. That’s right! Rails and its’ handy dandy generators made that one and talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;code smells&lt;/a&gt;. Phew, that shits worse than &lt;a href=&quot;http://amplicate.com/hate/wales/540484-wales-is-a-smelly-shithole/&quot;&gt;Whales&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shithole&quot;&gt;shithole&lt;/a&gt;, akin only to Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all new, old, aspiring, and even pining Rubyists out there: You suck unless you ashew provided tools and waste your time creating a simple but, “custom” controller. Yep, be “custom” over being effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Feelings Concerning PHP</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/02/26/Feelings-On-PHP/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/02/26/Feelings-On-PHP</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I can’t even say what’s wrong with PHP, because— okay. Imagine you have uh, a toolbox. A set of tools. Looks okay, standard stuff in there.
You pull out a screwdriver, and you see it’s one of those weird tri-headed things. Okay, well, that’s not very useful to you, but you guess it comes in handy sometimes.
You pull out the hammer, but to your dismay, it has the claw part on both sides. Still serviceable though, I mean, you can hit nails with the middle of the head holding it sideways.
You pull out the pliers, but they don’t have those serrated surfaces; it’s flat and smooth. That’s less useful, but it still turns bolts well enough, so whatever.
And on you go. Everything in the box is kind of weird and quirky, but maybe not enough to make it completely worthless. And there’s no clear problem with the set as a whole; it still has all the tools.
Now imagine you meet millions of carpenters using this toolbox who tell you “well hey what’s the problem with these tools? They’re all I’ve ever used and they work fine!” And the carpenters show you the houses they’ve built, where every room is a pentagon and the roof is upside-down. And you knock on the front door and it just collapses inwards and they all yell at you for breaking their door.
That’s what’s wrong with PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/&quot;&gt;I could not have said it better&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;http://baselinescenario.com/2013/02/09/the-importance-of-excel/#&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; should be a surprise to everyone. The sad part? It isn’t.
Moreover, if you want to appear as as an absolute nutter, call Excel a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote for your book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Excel is to Business Evolution as &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/d__cHglvOM0&quot;&gt;automatic flushing&lt;/a&gt; toilets is to Human Evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Make it Sexy Productive</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/02/02/Make-It-Sexy-Productive/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/02/02/Make-It-Sexy-Productive</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Before you blow your precious time on this post, feel free to listen to this
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.70decibels.com/mikesonmics/2013/2/1/episode-53-a-productive-argument-with-matt-alexander.html&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; then come back and finish reading. Done? Ok, great. My takeaway
was that my “productive” life is filled with all kinds of tangents. Most, never
diverge back into anything. They remain un-attended appendages, dangling in my
mind until some unforseen force lops them off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50730705aac422613b000001/big&quot;&gt;tinkerer&lt;/a&gt; I am, I set out to rid myself of all the estraneous shit
that has plagued my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doitfuckingnow.com/&quot;&gt;GSD&lt;/a&gt; system for the past year.
In doing so, I ended up with three objects that will be an integral part of my
productivity strides in 2013. And without further ado, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irl&quot;&gt;IRL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lamen+terms&quot;&gt;lamen&lt;/a&gt; in the room, IRL is broken down nicely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRL&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, especially
the second definition. Anywho, this by far is the category with the most stuff in
it. The most being two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;field-notes5&quot;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/&quot;&gt;Field Notes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always struggled to fit Field Notes and the smaller
Moleskines into my life. They seem just small enough where I struggle to get
anything coherent into them. Moreover, there are little times where I raise pen to
paper and don’t write an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=mitchener&amp;amp;sprefix=bosch+icon%2Caps%2C162&quot;&gt;epic novella&lt;/a&gt;. By holding onto the fact that anything placed into
these little guys must be brilliant, I almost never actually write anything in them.
They just take up way too much space around the house and eventually, the wife
ends up throwing them out or using them to write down grocery lists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the thought of a grocery list in them used to revolt me, I have begun to use
them in the same fashion. They aren’t a recepticle for the next Odyssey, they are
a utilitarian piece of paper. Once I got this wrapped around my head, their use
has become all the more apparent. I throw variables that I need to remember in there,
the three big things I need to do today, really whatever. At the end of the week,
when my review comes around I pull the current one out and flip through it, jotting
down anything that needs to be remembered. Very freeing, and with the Field Notes brand
going bannanas these days, it is easy to find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/&quot;&gt;cedar recepticle&lt;/a&gt; to store your used ones in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;levengerbehance-circa-book6&quot;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/product/29/action-circa-notebook&quot;&gt;Levenger/Behance Circa Book&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a recent puchase that was more of a whim, than anything. Having never
subscribed to the action method, I had no idea what I was getting into. The draw was
that the book itself is refillable and dot paper is the shit. After using it for
a couple of weeks it has a place in my life that is more permanent than a Field Notes
book. I am more apt to use each page on a project by project base and link everything
together with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/12/05/how-to-take-notes-like-an-alpha-geek-plus-my-2600-date-challenge/&quot;&gt;table of contents&lt;/a&gt;. There isn’t as much feedom as with the
Field Notes, however this notebook doesn’t tend to travel far from my workbench. In addition,
I enjoy the paper size and tend to doodle and draw in-between notes, where space
is at a premium with the Field Notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital&quot;&gt;Digital&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is easy: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/&quot;&gt;Omnifocus&lt;/a&gt;. I spent a good amount of time in 2009 in an
attempt to fit Omnifocus into my workflow. The idea of GTD was simple however,
and this is something I can’t comprehend now, Omnifocus just didn’t gel. It was always
a struggle to get information into the program along with organizing it once it was there.
2 Years later in 2011 I was doing a small side project and it all clicked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since, I have put my faith in Omnigroup both on the iPad and the iPhone.
Due to the high amount of content already available about this application, I am
going to keep things light and say that yes, it is complicated but, very much
worth it. Once you grep the overall workflow I doubt you will go back to a
“simpler” solution. Moreover, the Omnigroup has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/entry/debut-of-omnifocus-2&quot;&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; Omnifocus 2
which means that they plan to align the Mac version with the much more updated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/&quot;&gt;mobile
variants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fin&quot;&gt;Fin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three arms have kept my mind free to creativly think about upcoming projects
as well as keep everything considered “current,” on track. Things will probably change, they always do,
rest assured, I might write about it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Show Yourself Off</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/01/22/Show-Yourself-Off/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/01/22/Show-Yourself-Off</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Getting crazy ideas usually leads people down the road to a lot of fun, yet
potentially wasted amounts of time. This is how creativity is formed. And this
writer is no different. I happened to be bored one night and thought:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;how difficult is it for people to get a grasp on how “haphazardly good” a particular programmer might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any company or recruiter could dig through the expanse of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bradendouglass&quot;&gt;our Github&lt;/a&gt;
profiles but, we usually hoard so much weird stuff in there. In addition, they
are rife with forks that we never took the time to do anything with. If Github
doesn’t accomplish their needs then do they move on to the developers blogs? Many of these
are digital wastelands, filled with confusing UI, large images of their console colors,
and articles from 2011. Shit, that’s a bust as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take all of the Front-Enders, the UX experts, and the general Web Designer,
these people have a collection of their work that they dub “a portfolio”. Since,
Github is too convoluted of a profile, how do we as developers build a portfolio
like product? My solution was to build an app that is inherently simple, however;
shows off what I could do within the framework/language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of my toils? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bradendouglass/rails_presentation&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt;. The application is a cross between Rails and
BackboneJs. Instead of using GIT as a log of items, I opted to throw mine into
a running “thought log” in the readme. The result isn’t something that resembles a traditional
portfolio, yet it requires less code reading and easily shows off the way the
I breaks down problems during the build process. For the Prag Prog lovers out there,
this could not be considered a “toy app” due to the infrequency of updates that
it will accrue. In addition, mine will likely never see production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far from perfect; however, embodies a very clear function and process. Without further
ado… BOOM!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Old Guard</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/01/04/The-Old-Guard/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2013/01/04/The-Old-Guard</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you happen to listen to these things called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast&quot;&gt;smodcasts&lt;/a&gt;? If you don’t,
than there is a good chance you missed &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/webahead/45&quot;&gt;this episode of the Web Ahead&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Malarkey&quot;&gt;Andy Clark&lt;/a&gt; had a solid rant concerning the Old VS New guard of the web.
Another person who feels relatively passionate towards this subject would be
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drewwilson.com/&quot;&gt;Drew Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who puts on &lt;a href=&quot;http://valiocon.com/&quot;&gt;Valio Con&lt;/a&gt;, which aims at bringing “young guns”
into the speaking spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone remember when Coda and Textmate were new on the scene? When I see
people continuing to use these tools I make a concoious effort to interrupt their
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50730705aac422613b000001/big&quot;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt; and ask them what they are working on in &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeescript.org/&quot;&gt;Coffeescript&lt;/a&gt;? Or
better yet: how they enjoy Compass? Sure this could be construed as a “dick”
approach however, you learn a lot about people while being said: dick. In 99%
of these mentioned interactions I am gifted with a face that expresses both
confusion and an utter sense of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big&quot;&gt;discomfort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to prod deeper into what these “Web Professionals” do, you realize
that whatever it is, it has no outside influence. They don’t spend Saturdays
flipping through specs or reading other people’s code on Github. Rather, they
go to work and do the same thing they did yesterday; only changing when a client
shows or better yet, demmands something new. This reactive form of learning
is what separrates the Old from the New.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/22/talks-to-help-you-become-a-better-front-end-engineer-in-2013/&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine wrote a recent article&lt;/a&gt; about how to do just
this: “stay up to date.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you as a “Web Professional” think it is hard, than
yes, it is. Why? Well, the fact is that you have been resting on HTML and jQuery
for too damn long. It is time to wake the fuck up, smell the Coffeescript and
learn all the cool things that ‘the kids are doing.’ Why? The simple answer is
that you have already coded yourself out of a job. If you want to keep learning,
that job will likely still be there. However, if you continue to be a curmudgeon
about the whole subject, than you just might be… Properly Fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all good posts, this shall end with an epic list. The list will be broken
up by headlines describing the following projects. Find one that looks cool and
give it a whirl. Hate it? Drop and try something else.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tmux Powerline Pimping</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/12/28/Tmux-Powerline-Pimping/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/12/28/Tmux-Powerline-Pimping</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Alright folks if you don’t use &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux&quot;&gt;Tmux&lt;/a&gt; you are pretty much doing it 100% wrong
and you won’t get much out of this post. Also, I understand… or “&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big&quot;&gt;hear&lt;/a&gt;” that
Screen is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big&quot;&gt;wicked awesome-tastic&lt;/a&gt;; however, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I+could+give+two+shits&quot;&gt;I couldn’t&lt;/a&gt; care less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for by some miracle, you do use Tmux, why aren’t you using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? Sure,
it is a little colorful, and a bit noisy… but, yeah feel free to tell your
friends you found it, and you didn’t hear it from me. Right, since most of the
segments are just bash scripts I have been searching for one that will show off
the current temp of the machine. What joy I must have been in when I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://coderwall.com/p/cmw1mq&quot;&gt;this
snippet from Coderwall&lt;/a&gt;. Although, it is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big&quot;&gt;wicked surprised&lt;/a&gt; as well. Besides, does “Coderwall”
sound like a place where people go to circlejerk to anyone else… wait, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that between that…“Coderwall” and now, Tmux-powerline has gone
through a rewrite and yielded the snippet useless. Since there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsfiddle.net/&quot;&gt;real place
for these kinds of things&lt;/a&gt;, here is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/4404483&quot;&gt;correct code in the form of a gist&lt;/a&gt;.
Place the code into a newly written file in the segments directory and name it
something smart(with a &lt;code&gt;.sh&lt;/code&gt; file extension). Then, run &lt;code&gt;chmod a+x filename&lt;/code&gt; to
make the script &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50b6270eaac4228f36000009/big&quot;&gt;super executable&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, add it into your theme and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOOM!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is smcFanControl in the menu bar and in Tmux both use the same
binary to read the temp. However, on my Macbook Air there is a 5-10 degree
differance between the two. Must be due to the fact that the temp is in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big&quot;&gt;Celcius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>In The Pipe</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/12/21/2012-In-The-Pipe/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/12/21/2012-In-The-Pipe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That’s right bitches! We are done &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a/big&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. 2012 is all but a bunch of history,
something that we will remember in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;rear view mirror&lt;/a&gt;. On a side note,
I would hope that some of those plays are due to my incessant linking to it.
To be fair though, it is pretty fucking epic. Anyway, if you aren’t listening
to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=metric+shit+ton&quot;&gt;metric-shit-ton&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rd.io/x/QVoeADMzpQ&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, you hate &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5045518529ca15f836000020/big&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/4LJw6PAi5Q8&quot;&gt;hat tip&lt;/a&gt;, the metric system is “&lt;strong&gt;badass&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what would a top ten of this year look like? Glad you asked. Without further
ado, keep it &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big&quot;&gt;real&lt;/a&gt; for the rest of the year, be prepared for the 13, and
enjoy the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/&quot;&gt;OSX&lt;/a&gt;: Yes, perhaps I am a self proclaimed Apple lover but, it is hard to
argue with the fit and finish of BSD, Linux, and Unix that Apple has accomplished
with their recent OS release. Kudos and if you have an issue with “planned
obsolescence”, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface&quot;&gt;buy one of these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robbwolf.com/what-is-the-paleo-diet/&quot;&gt;Paleo living&lt;/a&gt;: I have spent a good part of the year following a rigorous
Paleo diet and am convinced that we are brainwashed by bread and McDonalds.
I have never felt better, stronger, etc. The food might seem a little weird
(beef heart) but, it is well worth the experience/experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50b6270eaac4228f36000009/big&quot;&gt;Quiting&lt;/a&gt;: Not something that everyone should look to do. However, if you
are feeling stuck, now, rather than later is the best time to quit. Do something
fresh, exciting, scary, whatever!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Podcasts: This one seems to slip into every top 10 list since 2009, when I started
podcasting. If you yearn (in your pants yabbies) to learn, than it it hard not to glean
something from listening. Here are a few current ones from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/ow7dlm20y6qbpba/Subscriptions-bPhone.opml&quot;&gt;recent Instacast dump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdio.com/&quot;&gt;Rdio&lt;/a&gt;: Hot on the list of audible items, Rdio and it’s stylish design
wax the music nerd in me. Having a plethora of mp3s on my computer doesn’t make
much sense when you can stream an unlimited amount of anything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/&quot;&gt;Apartment Therapy&lt;/a&gt;: My wife and myself recently moved into our first
apartment where we didn’t share space with friends or a roommate. After living
for so long with people, you shed most of your unneeded belongings. This means
that we had a lot of shopping to do and much of it inspired from this blog.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/imac/&quot;&gt;Apple’s New iMac&lt;/a&gt;: Being a laptop man, I rarely look towards Apple’s
desktop offerings. However, this has changed with their recent upgrade. I have
spent a few minutes with the 27inch model and the take away is: the Fusion drive
seems brilliant and overall the machine is a beast of power and beauty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Surgery. If you are an athlete and you are sitting on a past injury…and you
have health insurance, you are a moron. I have been nursing a failing shoulder for
nearly 10 years. This year I gave up and had surgery and I will never look back.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trivia: wading into the trivia waters can be a shark filled affair. There are
some players out there that are unbelievable with the knowledge they have access to
at the tip of their subconscious. I gave it a whirl and although, our team has yet
to become spectacular, we have learned a lot. Moral? Do something you suck at and
keep doing it even if you never get better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Javascript: Javascript was my &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer&quot;&gt;language of the year&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, I learned
Coffeescript, a little bit of Node, and a bunch of other random stuff. I am still
no where near as efficient in it as I am Ruby; however, there is a spot in my heart
for this unruly little functional language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, that’s all she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Boredom To Getting Something Done</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/12/16/Boredom-To-Getting-Something-Done/"/>
   <updated>2012-12-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/12/16/Boredom-To-Getting-Something-Done</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posts have been a little sparse lately due to me moving to a new job and needing
to learn how to ‘do’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50b6270eaac4228f36000009/big&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt; again. However, there has been a few instances where
I have found myself completely bored. To fight the need to tool around on &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/4f65e376300aaa98270000b8/big&quot;&gt;hacker news&lt;/a&gt;
in these situations, I give you &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oops, I actually meant &lt;a href=&quot;http://bc5e368a8867af61c3ed-e931c6f21220c188f04654bd7a220e82.r14.cf2.rackcdn.com/omnifocus_blog.png&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. It might be a little hard to ‘grep’ what’s
going on in the picture but here is the idea. Whatever system you use to keep yourself
in-check and productive, probably utilizes tags or ‘contexts’ for the true &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355686690&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=gtd&quot;&gt;GTDers&lt;/a&gt;.
Create a tag that is as simple as ‘Web’. The next part is hard but, with some simple
conditioning, success isn’t far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start training yourself to look back at this context every time you find yourself
bored on the Internet. When you feel that nagging need to navigate to Facebook, Pinterest, or Pandora, stop.
Think about what you are doing, then click on your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/&quot;&gt;productivity suite&lt;/a&gt; of choice
and see what you &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big&quot;&gt;really could be doing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method hinges on a couple of things that are rather ‘long tail’ if an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/wilt&quot;&gt;Internet
consumption addiction&lt;/a&gt; has already taken root. The biggest and by far the hardest
is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/1400069289/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1355687216&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=habits&quot;&gt;developing the habit&lt;/a&gt; to look back at your todo-list every time you find your
focus wavering. However, if mastered, the things that might get finally finished
will astonish everyone. Give it a whirl and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/braidn&quot;&gt;hit me up on twitter&lt;/a&gt; with the results!&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2012-11-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/11/21/MDN-At-Your-Finger-Tips</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this tip centers around the use of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; but, doesn’t
require the premium “Power Pack”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;MDN&lt;/a&gt; is…or should be a go-to for
anyone doing any level of front-end development. It is an indispensible
knowledge base on anything concerning HTML, CSS, or Js. Since Alfred has
a great way to add custom searches, we can pipe items into Alfred and
have it pass the search onto MDN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The string to get this started is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q={query}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDN also encodes spaces as &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; symbols so one will have to check the
appropriate box within the Alfred Custom Search settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you have a question about how &lt;code&gt;line-height&lt;/code&gt; works you can simply
type &lt;code&gt;mdn line-height&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stupendous success.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vimwiki is Everywhere</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/31/VimWiki-Everywhere/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/31/VimWiki-Everywhere</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Confused about Vim, wiki’s, or Google? &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/vimwiki/&quot;&gt;You are welcome&lt;/a&gt;. Although
vimwiki is a wiki implementation within Vim, it passes off a lot of cool
things that bleed into &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; based writing. However, it often
only works on .md files. This is a pain point since some things use
.markdown files (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohloh.net/p/gollum-wiki&quot;&gt;gollum&lt;/a&gt;) or .mdown files. Vim will filetype highlight
things using both of these filetypes however it won’t sugar it up with
Vimwiki syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrong…well, sorta. Vimwiki drags around a couple of config flags that
can be used to syntax-up Vim when using all types of common markdown
extensions. And….:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let g:vimwiki_ext2syntax = {&#39;.md&#39;,: &#39;markdown&#39;, &#39;.markdown&#39;:
&#39;markdown&#39;, &#39;.mdown&#39;: &#39;markdown&#39;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/3989510&quot;&gt;gist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boom! Vimwiki syntax in all your markdown files. Be happy, write in
markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Pow Lessons</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/26/Pow-Lessons/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/26/Pow-Lessons</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many fine &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/pa9xA.gif&quot;&gt;Rails Devs&lt;/a&gt; lean on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pow.cx/&quot;&gt;Pow&lt;/a&gt; to locally “host” their apps
in dev mode. Up until a few days ago, I really didn’t use Pow very much.
However, in a fit of boredom, I decided to see what it could do. The
answer? &lt;a href=&quot;http://shechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/6715_f54b.gif&quot;&gt;Crash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a really odd issue in Pow (maybe due to its lax
dev schedule) that affects us &lt;a href=&quot;http://tmux.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Tmux&lt;/a&gt; evangelists. If you initiate the
install script while in a session, the install fails miserably. Just
pop out, reinstall, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;boom&lt;/a&gt;, all is well in your Rail’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, I really hope that 37 Signals doesn’t abandon the project
because there really has been little work on it as of late. Then again,
maybe it is so well made it doesn’t need any “real” maintance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Happy &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/FHWMO.gif&quot;&gt;Whiskey&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://journeyfriday.com/&quot;&gt;Journey&lt;/a&gt; Friday!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hand Writing Code</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/07/Writing-Code-On-Whiteboards-Is-For-The-Birds/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/07/Writing-Code-On-Whiteboards-Is-For-The-Birds</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This should come to no surprise to anyone: I love searching for jobs.
When you have been fired as many times as I have from yobs, you learn to
enjoy the process that is involved in nailing one down. Yes, this makes
me perfect for the freelance role; however, I have yet to find a way to
break into that club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I spent this Friday in a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502bb359aac422024400002d/big&quot;&gt;surprise interview&lt;/a&gt;” and nailed
every last section besides…yep, you guessed it: the technical section.
It isn’t that I freeze or can’t answer their questions, it is the simple
fact that writing code on a whiteboard is the least functional way to
figure out what someone knows. The equivalent is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. And,
personally, my hips aren’t that mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best techincal interviews I ever had the grace to be apart of
was with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getharvest.com/&quot;&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. It was all over the phone, no code writing on a
fucking whiteboard, and 100% of it relevant to what occurs while working
with a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownfield_(software_development)&quot;&gt;brown field app&lt;/a&gt;”. If you are a hiring manger, please think
carefully about your technical questions and &lt;strong&gt;DON’T&lt;/strong&gt; make the
participant scribble their answer on a board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://seeknuance.com/2008/02/15/interview-whiteboard-coding-tests-are-usually-worthless/&quot;&gt;This blog post&lt;/a&gt; nicely defines some of the more “technical”
reasons behind why programming on whiteboards makes little sense.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NVM without Xcode</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/07/NVM-Without-Xcode-Installed/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/10/07/NVM-Without-Xcode-Installed</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since you are a kick-ass developer, you own a Macbook Air (most of us
do) yet, you are constantly pressed
for moah hard drive space. With Xcode being a bit “&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big&quot;&gt;portly&lt;/a&gt;”, “there has
got to be a better way”…to do stuff. The kick-ass peeps at
&lt;a href=&quot;http://thoughtbot.com/&quot;&gt;Thoughtbot&lt;/a&gt; have a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/27985816073/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-riding-a-mountain-lion&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; walking someone through
setting up a sweet Ruby dev environment on a brand new, Mountain Lion
powered Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that is done, send some sweet traffic to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderwall.com/p/dtbuqg&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;. It
walks through some needed tweaks when running the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Interesting-Taps-%26-Branches&quot;&gt;homebrew-dupes&lt;/a&gt; version
of gcc. Finally, run this command in your favorite shell to tell NVM
(and other “items of importance”) where your Xcode installation
“resides”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo xcode-select -switch /usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you run &lt;code&gt;nvm install v.0.x.x&lt;/code&gt; it won’t fail because you feel
Xcode is a bloated pig and it doesn’t deserve your hard drive’s
time-of-day. In addition, you have a lean, mean way to build some really
cool shit with two awesome languages.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/09/22/Koans-Eh-Rific</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To think that this blog went through a steep declined after August is a
damn crying shame. Also, I could have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5045518529ca15f836000020/big&quot;&gt;lost&lt;/a&gt; but, that is
neither &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f67e29ca154572000000/big&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; nor there. Also, and perhaps a complete surprise is a
post about shit I actually do…like for a living. Without further ado:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should come to no surprise to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ardmorelibrary.org/literacy/images/oneoutoffive.jpg&quot;&gt;readers of this blog&lt;/a&gt; (that
poster is sandbagging) that I love &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans&quot;&gt;Ruby koans&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically the
ones maintained by the wonderful people at Edgecase. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan#Varieties_in_koan-practice&quot;&gt;Koans&lt;/a&gt;, for the
peeps who have no clue are a staple in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&quot;&gt;apprenticeship movement&lt;/a&gt;
and are an easy and repeatable way to hone your skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok so practicing is a good thing, but how do we make said practice more
fluid? To accomplish fluid…ness, is that right? We are going to need
some tools, of which might be a little frightening to the new sotware
developer. Don’t fret:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vim&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benmills/vimux&quot;&gt;Vimux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tmux.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;Tmux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.screened.com/uploads/0/5115/407558-airbud1_super.jpg&quot;&gt;bud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems people have with koans is the tedium of
jumping back and forth between your editor and terminal to run the &lt;code&gt;rake&lt;/code&gt;
command. Problem solved. Open your current koan with Vim in the terminal.
You can throw MacVim &lt;a href=&quot;http://thegrio.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/romney-looking-out-the-window-16x9.jpg?w=650&quot;&gt;out the window&lt;/a&gt; (the fact that we can fly still amazes that guy). Create a split(vertical) window with
Tmux and navigate up a directory to where the rakefile is located. Hop
back over to your Vim instance and initiate: Vimux-RunVimTmuxCommand.
For me this is bound to &lt;code&gt;leader rp&lt;/code&gt;, type “rake” and BOOM. Your koan
information should be stdout…ing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to actually jump to the adjacent tmux window, no need to jump
out of your typing environment, and no need to break your awesome koan-like
focus. Another hat tip would be to use the RunVimTmuxLastCommand instead
of having to continually type rake in the the Vimux window. BOOM! Fluidity
leveled up.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you agree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wasigh.com/scariest-thing-resigned/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; we have a problem. Srsly, like dialing

employment with a company that you don’t own is the scariest thing you
can think of… I don’t know, go think of these &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2012/jul/30/ants/&quot;&gt;ants&lt;/a&gt;. They are
about 1 million times more scary than quiting a job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vimninjas.com/2012/09/03/5-plugins-you-should-put-in-your-vimrc/&quot;&gt;not download these plugins&lt;/a&gt;. Also, how about
the scariest thing you could think of is getting traffic tanked by
Hacker News? It is 9-est on Monday (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.historyhouse.com/in_history/webster/&quot;&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt; day) and there is 0

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For everyone who had an unproductive, bad, uninteresting, boring, or
otherwise shitty Friday please click on &lt;a href=&quot;http://journeyfriday.com/&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and spend 13 minutes
basking in what can only be described as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big&quot;&gt;Pure Fucking Awesome Sauce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it…for realz! I don’t have anything else to say but:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lists will tank your time on site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not much of a google analytics &lt;a href=&quot;http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129692&quot;&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt; (suriously, I used to love
MTG); however, I thought it would be interesting to see how this
blogging &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a/big&quot;&gt;foray&lt;/a&gt; has impacted the traffic to this here site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To my suprise, there has been quite an uptick on visitor front. HOWEVER,
I clicked the compare to time on site and saw the opposite. Although,
there were more people visiting the site, they were quicker to leave,
perhaps because most of the stuff being presented was kinda bland, off
the cough for the past month. This, coupled with the very unedity side
of life is what forced people away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this post isn’t going to help much on that front either. Being the
last post of the month I would like to thank all of the people who
attempted to read my ramblings as well as the people who immediately
turned tail and ran away as fast as fucking possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG6b3V2MNxQ&quot;&gt;Thanks for all the fish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Something Random</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/30/A-Thursday/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/30/A-Thursday</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post will be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big&quot;&gt;quick and dirty&lt;/a&gt; rundown of what is banging
around in my head today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-post&quot;&gt;This Post&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PMU7W3HEbaQ/T8NBPZ66XFI/AAAAAAAABYk/AQCRm7tEoMM/s1600/friendship_kittens.png&quot;&gt;good friends&lt;/a&gt; and myself have been working to start up a
coworking location &lt;a href=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Z51A_ZeS5_U/UD2YH_wk47I/AAAAAAAA2Ko/Cu4FFmV7e6M/6282012025632iwsmt.jpeg&quot;&gt;where we live&lt;/a&gt;. Today, there happened to be a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://founderware.co/start-up/ten-rules-for-shared-working-spaces/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; make its way to the front page of Hacker news that highlights some
“&lt;a href=&quot;https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/dbf5c065a2351c45eff08176351af29716fe7bec687474703a2f2f6769746875622d696d616765732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f626c6f672f323031312f6973737565732d6e6578742f746e672e706e67&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; with coworking locations.” I also realized that I have a
twitch when I am focusing really hard. It is a little hard to describe
but, it basically resembles &lt;a href=&quot;http://alexgiampapa.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/pickingyournose.jpg&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-car&quot;&gt;My Car&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drive sorta fast. Well my wife wouldn’t say so but I do. Today I
accidently pegged a divet in the road and &lt;a href=&quot;http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fuck-you-i-am-cat.jpg&quot;&gt;blew a tire&lt;/a&gt;. Goodbye 200
dollars. Very sad about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-yobs&quot;&gt;Current Yobs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there hadn’t been to much talk about this for some time but, a
week ago I was left with the entire techology sector on my plate. Before
I was more of a programmer than a technologist which has changed very
quickly. When a programmer is saddled with help desk and opperations
based work, they tend to have a hard time switching gears. Or maybe I
just have said problem. This definitely of makes me sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-30-days-blogging&quot;&gt;My 30 Days Blogging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been hard, it is over tomorrow, it was hard, but it was well
worth all of the work. I am sure there will be more of a timeframe
between posts going forward but, I am going to make a conscious effort
to make the quality of said posts a whole lot better than the past
month. Hopefully I didn’t drive too many people away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kindles&quot;&gt;Kindles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/30/3280770/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-display&quot;&gt;the Verge&lt;/a&gt; have gotten their mits on what could be
the new Kindle Fire and e-ink versions. I have been rocking a 2nd
generation Kindle since 09 and definitely like what I am seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unedited&quot;&gt;Unedited&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It flows better that way…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Journal</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/29/A-Programmers-Journal/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-29T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/29/A-Programmers-Journal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t quite as &lt;a href=&quot;http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/21414/screenshots/478981/addicted.jpg&quot;&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker news&lt;/a&gt; as most of us
are, this is a reaction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/3444793&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;. In the past few days, the
idea/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Official-Visual-Basic-Programmers-Journal/dp/078970465X?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/a&gt;(HMM…Visual Basic 4, sure brings back &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;memories&lt;/a&gt;) of
a programmers journal seems to be gaining steam on the interwebs. The
idea is really quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Keep a journal of daily things, todos, hang ups, ideas, etc that
pertain to only the world of programming. You can look back on them
and quantify the tragectory of your &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/503258b5aac422d76f000036/big&quot;&gt;thought process&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty cool huh? Not sure if it needed to be a block quote but it
happened. The above post really advocates keeping a physical journal (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-14-Fun-Found-In-Notecards&quot;&gt;as
do I&lt;/a&gt;); however, I was quite surprised how many people use text files instead.
Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, many programmers are generally concerned about creating a lot of
paper waste. Most of our jobs are designed to rid the workplace of paper
alltogether. This space though, &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; the programmer’s journal space,
should be filled with great &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340b0029ca154d3d000026/big&quot;&gt;physical&lt;/a&gt; notebooks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://edison.rutgers.edu/&quot;&gt;Edison&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-books-notebook-from-edison-machine-works-by-nikola-tesla&quot;&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/vanWyhe_notebooks.html&quot;&gt;Darwin&lt;/a&gt; all kept a journal, and I am 99% positive that theirs weren’t
unmanagably long text files. Without further ado, a list. Here are my top requirements for a good,
real, paper programmers journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It must be bendy and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_webnotebook.shtml&quot;&gt;13x21&lt;/a&gt; cm or larger. I have never been a fan
of Moleskine’s notebooks (although the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/search?q=zebra+sansa+clip&quot;&gt;Evernote one&lt;/a&gt; could
be cool) but, their journals are fairly great. The only thing missing
in their exhaustive line is a dot grid option and I would leap on
that in a second if a chance were to arise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The notebook should exude creativity but contain the user within a
small grid. That is why lined and blank books don’t really work.
Grids are good and dots are about as good as you can get. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_webnotebook.shtml&quot;&gt;Rhodia&lt;/a&gt; has a great product; however,
all of their notebooks have a hard cover. which goes against the
whole idea of “bendy.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A great pen and pencil. Yep both! Most of the time I use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/search?q=zebra+sansa+clip&quot;&gt;pen&lt;/a&gt;
from Zebra or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.3-mm-Basic-Colors-Blue-Black/pd/50&quot;&gt;Pilot&lt;/a&gt; and a lead holder from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/Rotring-300-Lead-Holder-2-mm-Black-Body/pd/8036&quot;&gt;Rotring&lt;/a&gt;.
Experiment and find what you like in your hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned yesterday, it is hard to incorporate something new, and
perhaps difficult into your daily routine. With a notebook, slide it
between your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elitekeyboards.com/&quot;&gt;keyboard&lt;/a&gt; and monitor. That way it is always in the
way of you and your creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fin…just promise me: “Don’t use a fucking text file for your
programming journal”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Do One Thing Every Day</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/28/Do-One-Thing-Every-Day/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/28/Do-One-Thing-Every-Day</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;Pants&lt;/a&gt;, if for some reason you don’t know what goes in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is surprisingly &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/503abec229ca15f37500000d/big&quot;&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt;, which happens to be contrary to most of
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://8.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/amercia/%40warpafx.jpg&quot;&gt;jowels out there&lt;/a&gt;. What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; hard is doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340b0029ca154d3d000026/big&quot;&gt;shit&lt;/a&gt;
consistently. Every day to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to keep this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; squared away until the very end of
this little test. An experiment to try and write &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-02-30-Days-of-Blogging&quot;&gt;1 post every day&lt;/a&gt;
for the month of August. Posts could be on a myriad of subjects but,
they all had to be &amp;gt; 200 words and posted during the hours of each
day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn’t Friday, which happens to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;amp;q=official&amp;amp;tbs=imgo:1&amp;amp;biw=1440&amp;amp;bih=828&amp;amp;sei=IHM9UNmJEoym8ATepIGoDw&quot;&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; end of the month
but, here are some really quick reflections on doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret&quot;&gt;one thing, every day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s hard. Being able to produce 200 words of prose each day is super
easy. Making said prose make a lick of sense or even be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.memlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Apple-Remote-01.jpg&quot;&gt;remotely&lt;/a&gt;
interesting is pretty fucking hard.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a product like OmniFocus or &lt;a href=&quot;https://hollyapp.com/&quot;&gt;Holly&lt;/a&gt; to list out ideas as they
come by. I did this more at the beginning and got laxed towards the
end which has been the result of a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big&quot;&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you first sit down at a desk everyday, open your daily post and
work on it throughout the day. Inevitably the post will be better
than cramming it into 1 hour at night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build in one cheat day. I didn’t do this and I am glad that I didn’t.
However, there will be a time where you are away from a computer and
have no way to properly construct a post. No one is a failure if they
miss one day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make it fun.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Teach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fin.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/27/Things-That-Are-Not-Worth-Caring-About</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codejacked.com/know-your-keyboard-bang-splat-whack/&quot;&gt;splat&lt;/a&gt; means than you are in the wrong

happens to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://strictlystrengthproject.com/wp-content/uploads/HappyMon.jpg&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt;, and Mondays happen to proceed the epically
boring Sunday. Equally boring, Mondays are rife for some positive &lt;a href=&quot;http://teuxdeux.com/&quot;&gt;list
production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike a few weeks ago, where we looked at some small things that were
going on in the community, today we will run &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everythingaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2003_the_rundown_020.jpg&quot;&gt;down the opposite&lt;/a&gt;.
Without going too much into depth (wouldn’t want to spoil it), here are
just a few things “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I+could+give+two+shits&quot;&gt;I couldn’t be bothered to give two shits&lt;/a&gt;“…about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.google.com/news?ned=us&amp;amp;q=twitter%20api&amp;amp;btnG=Search+News&quot;&gt;Twitter’s New TOS&lt;/a&gt;: Or API changes, or whatever. When it comes
down to it, a small fraction of people actually use Twitter. In
addition, an &lt;strong&gt;EVEN&lt;/strong&gt; smaller section know what a 3rd party app is.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://us5.memecdn.com/How-I-feel-about-America_c_66102.jpg&quot;&gt;Google ++,&lt;/a&gt; Twitter is the new Facebook, everyone wants to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big&quot;&gt;hate on it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

much to link to, I just dumped something in there. There was a
verdict, now someone is crying, so there isn’t now. Who the fuck
cares. Oh, one more thing, Samsung and all of their &lt;a href=&quot;http://9to5mac.com/2012/08/27/youve-seen-apples-internal-memo-to-employees-on-the-verdict-now-heres-samsungs/&quot;&gt;letters&lt;/a&gt;.
Actually, if Fortune 500’s could just &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.smartbear.com/Portals/175832/images/office-space-boss1.jpg&quot;&gt;quit with the memos&lt;/a&gt; all
together, that would &lt;a href=&quot;http://youlooknicetoday.com/&quot;&gt;be nice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok and here are some things to coutneract &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big&quot;&gt;all that negativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When it comes to self improvement, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1346026480&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=apprenticeship+patterns&quot;&gt;improvement overall&lt;/a&gt;, one of
the hardest things to do is admit that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big&quot;&gt;you might not know
something&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the time we couldn’t even list, in any order, the
things that “we don’t know.” Not one. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340aa129ca15433d000010/big&quot;&gt;Suriously&lt;/a&gt;, try really hard
and use &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/503abec229ca15f37500000d/big&quot;&gt;your power’s of awesome&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/about&quot;&gt;get a hold&lt;/a&gt; of me. For
myself? The hardest part of my software life, and therefore the thing I
have the least amount of experience with is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of having a master to work under and to pester with
questions is invaluable when it comes to walking the road from
an apprentice to a master. There are a few methods (IRC, message boards,
etc) that are acceptable if direct mentorship is not available. However,
these substitutes should not be used without looking for the real deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, and let’s be honest, it is a Sunday, here are
some cool ways to get hooked up with some web programmery based mentors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apprentice.io/&quot;&gt;Apprentice.io&lt;/a&gt;: a Boston based awesome sauce Ruby shop named
ThoughtBot have a really great thing going on. If you live in the
North-East or are mobile, this is one of the best programs to check
out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hashrocket.com/people/work-at-hashrocket/apprentice&quot;&gt;HashRocket&lt;/a&gt;: Another East coast Ruby company that has a lot of
cool people behind it. Pretty much the ThoughtBot of Florida.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hungryacademy.com/&quot;&gt;Hungry Academy&lt;/a&gt;: A devision of the folks at Living Social out of
DC. The program has only had one run but, they hired 100% of the
developers who went through it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeacademy.org/&quot;&gt;Code Academy&lt;/a&gt;: Chicago based program that focuses on the web
over specifically Ruby and Rails.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://devbootcamp.com/&quot;&gt;DevBootcamp&lt;/a&gt;: This program costs quite a lot at 11,200 but there
have been some rumblings about the first class seeing salaries hit
80k&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOOM!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Cheapest Of All</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/25/The-Cheapest-Of-All/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/25/The-Cheapest-Of-All</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I happened across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/cars-not-for-us-the-cheapest-generation-explains-the-freedom-of-not-owning/261516/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; this week and was rather
unastonished to hear that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobilize.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/millennials-30-up.jpg&quot;&gt;we&lt;/a&gt; are the cheapest generation ever.
Since many of my readers &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2011-12-19-People-Can-Not-Read&quot;&gt;can’t actually read&lt;/a&gt; here is a quick
one-over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the Millenials aren’t doing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;same shit&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tweedrun.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/PennyFarthing.jpg&quot;&gt;same
way&lt;/a&gt; as our parents. Oh, and this is bad btw, if you couldn’t infer
it. We are waiting until we hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mmw-competitive-112911.jpg&quot;&gt;middle age&lt;/a&gt; to think about new cars or
our first house. In addition, this kind of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://sundial.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/SO18-Tea-610x462.jpg&quot;&gt;fiscal responsibility&lt;/a&gt;”
is tanking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big&quot;&gt;great state of USA&lt;/a&gt; and pushing it into the path of &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.craftzine.com/Death_Star_watermelon.jpg&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response to 99% of this article and &lt;a href=&quot;http://experification.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/life2.jpg&quot;&gt;75% of 100% of life&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bullshit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, the “Global Stragegic Marketing” dude from GM in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; article
is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big&quot;&gt;tripping balls&lt;/a&gt;. You are 31, which means that you are only 4 or
so years away from being one yourself. Does this mean you don’t know who
you are? Likely. The rest of the article and the concept are right on,
along with some of the responses that have cropped up over the past few
days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t care, as a group of people, to be overly encumbered with
things. This doesn’t make us &lt;a href=&quot;http://grist.org/list/2012-01-04-this-guy-only-owns-15-things/&quot;&gt;this asshat&lt;/a&gt;. But, it does make us
conscious of every purchase we make. It has nothing to do with the
instability of our jobs(which definitely exists), or the lack of jobs in
general. It all boils down to one word: Freedom. Does your product get
us a little closer to attaining it? No? Well fuck off(said by a
generation of people with their wallets closed and their minds &lt;a href=&quot;http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photo/_new/080730-ped-texting-vmed-12p.380%3B380%3B7%3B70%3B0.jpg&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/a&gt; open).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Believe in Your Product</title>

   <updated>2012-08-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/24/Believe-In-Your-Product</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting a blog post with a story or a list is automatic &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big&quot;&gt;link love&lt;/a&gt;
from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckgo.com/?t=&quot;&gt;Googs&lt;/a&gt;…I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-story&quot;&gt;A Story&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happen to work for a really wonderful company that makes a good amount
of its profits from public transport. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502bb36faac4221844000002/big&quot;&gt;Planes, trains, buses&lt;/a&gt;, you name
it. Just not &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big&quot;&gt;automobiles&lt;/a&gt;. If you were to work at a place like this
and take pride in your product, you would likely ride the bus. Studying
every move people make, what defines their buying decisions. Moreover, even down
to what type of music they listen to as their public transport trudges
on…&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big&quot;&gt;consuming more of their day than their feedumb cars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your participation / &lt;a href=&quot;http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random&quot;&gt;devotion&lt;/a&gt; would lead you to purchasing the
product that you produced and believing the fact that someday, just
maybe, you could sell your car in favor of supporting the people that
make your life possible. I work to support public transport, and these
feelings &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big&quot;&gt;wash over me&lt;/a&gt; on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-deal&quot;&gt;The Deal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you produce a product and you can’t stand behind it by actually using
it, you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/business-punch.jpg&quot;&gt;no business being in business&lt;/a&gt;. What you are really in
it for is the money, and as we can see in our current economy, this
method doesn’t lead to sustainability. Today is Friday…I think. Take
the weekend to look over your current product and how you feel about it.
Are you passionate? If not, take Monday and Tuesday of next week to
reflect on the whole ordeal. If things look bleak by Wednesday, quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suriosly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this post was finished so close to the deadline that it was
finished without much editing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/ZQkxJ4WcXjA&quot;&gt;YUP&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Software Behind</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/23/Crop-Of-Todo-Managers/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/23/Crop-Of-Todo-Managers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of good ones out there at the moment, so without further
ado, here is your &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;incumbents&quot;&gt;Incumbents&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two that come to mind in this category are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/&quot;&gt;Things&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://culturedcode.com/things/&quot;&gt;OmniFocus&lt;/a&gt;. Both have iPhone and accompanying Mac apps and both
sync seamlessly between the two platforms. Things lacked this functionality in the
past but, it has recently been updated. Full disclosure, I am a
super-fan of OmniFocus and I also feel anything designed and or nudged
by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda&quot;&gt;Merlin Mann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://ethan.schoonover.usesthis.com/&quot;&gt;Ethan Schoonover&lt;/a&gt; is worth checking out /
using until they make something new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of bias, both of these applications will work well for your
daily to-do’s, with OmniFocus being much more tailored to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidco.com/&quot;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt;
methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fo-freeze&quot;&gt;FO Freeze&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two that we will talk about (there are quite a few in this category)
are the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html#reminders&quot;&gt;Apple Reminders app&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/&quot;&gt;Wunderlist&lt;/a&gt;. Both of these apps
will set you back a grand total of 0 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluebison.net/sketchbook/2008/0108/kiwi-small.png&quot;&gt;Yankee Dollar-y-Doos&lt;/a&gt; and both
will sync between your Apple powered devices. Wunderlist will even work
in a browser, Windows, and Linux. Both of these are more traditional
list managers and have fewer (read: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/503258b5aac422d76f000036/big&quot;&gt;less complex&lt;/a&gt;) frivolous
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in the market for a sleek, simple, and free app, take a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f2bf29ca153c71000025/big&quot;&gt;stroll&lt;/a&gt; and give one of these a whirl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;webby&quot;&gt;Webby&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three we will go over briefly (because really to get an idea of how
they work, you should be trying them out) are &lt;a href=&quot;http://asana.com/&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cheddarapp.com/&quot;&gt;Chedder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getflow.com/&quot;&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt;. These applications aren’t &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for the
web, all three of them have a mobile component, and Chedder even has an
early stage Mac client. Chedder is a really simple and fast set of lists
where Flow attempts to recreate the Things experience (half-hearted GTD)
on the web and Asana is great for working with teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fin&quot;&gt;Fin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a really quick, and dirty rundown of the current crop of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gadgetsdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SystemPanel-fo-Android-3-280x500.png&quot;&gt;task
managers&lt;/a&gt;. My recommendations? Give each one a whirl and see what
fits your lifestyle. Some of us have complex, “big boy” needs, while
others benefit from a simple list manager.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thinking in Markup</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/22/Think-In-Markup/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/22/Think-In-Markup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yep, so wait. What is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language&quot;&gt;Markup&lt;/a&gt;? Well if you happen to follow the
links on this blog (and you really are safer if you don’t), Wikipedia
catagorizes…or lists it into 3 distinct groups:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentational Markup&lt;/strong&gt;: Which happens to be the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt;-y type
stuff that &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;Word&lt;/a&gt; and other word processors use. In addition, this
style of markup is seldomly seen by the end user.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Procedural Markup&lt;/strong&gt;: What we will be focusing on. This style of
markup IS seen by the user and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big&quot;&gt;sprinkled&lt;/a&gt;(be ware the Wizard) throughout the text.
A preprocessor comes along, reads the text and hands the styled text
back to the user.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Descriptive Markup&lt;/strong&gt;: This form is sprinkled throughout the text,
much like the Procedural form; however, it has no bearing on a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor&quot;&gt;preprocessor&lt;/a&gt;. A good example of this is the hashtag(#tag) syntax
that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340aa129ca15433d000010/big&quot;&gt;some of us&lt;/a&gt; use on &lt;strike&gt;Twitter&lt;/strike&gt; AppDotNet to
catagorize our updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, until &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daltonc&quot;&gt;Dalton&lt;/a&gt; comes to his senses and realizes that he has a cool
project with a dumb name, &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.app.net/&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt; will be written that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are talking about here is a light language (sometimes called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Specific-Languages-Addison-Wesley-Signature-Series/dp/0321712943?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&quot;&gt;DSLs&lt;/a&gt;”)
that is used to express oneself beyond text. Anyone not see the beauty
in that? The user gets a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big&quot;&gt;free ride&lt;/a&gt; by using text documents that are
generated with style, flare and that never expire (text documents &lt;a href=&quot;http://textfiles.com/&quot;&gt;wont
be going out of style anytime soon&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of us, myself included have flocked to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.macworld.com/images/opinion/graphics/151235-gruber-small_original.jpg&quot;&gt;lovable&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. Originally it was used to style documents for web
viewing; however, now it has bleed into many text editors, iPhone and
Android editors, and it is still fairly prevalent when it comes to web
based writing. I have become so accustomed to the syntax, and
incorporated its usage into so many applications that my brain now
thinks on Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Markup language do you think in?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Breakable Toys</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/21/Breakable-Toys/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/21/Breakable-Toys</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not many people know this but, I am a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dvhardware.net/news/aerocool_top_gun.jpg&quot;&gt;huge fan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130988/&quot;&gt;this
movie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382?tag=duckduckgo-d-20&quot;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;. Since this happens to be less of a blog
about movies and more on &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/AruKI.jpg&quot;&gt;self help&lt;/a&gt; and software engineering, lets
tackle the latter. Although, if you are feeling particularly
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/AruKI.jpg&quot;&gt;bored tonight&lt;/a&gt;, do rent the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking shit! Alright, so guessing that you didn’t pick up the book?
Right, &lt;a href=&quot;http://toolsandtoys.net/&quot;&gt;breakable toys&lt;/a&gt; refers to a piece of code/application/software
that is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340aa129ca15433d000010/big&quot;&gt;near and dear to the your heart&lt;/a&gt; yet, perhaps not
“&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/xP1-oquwoL8&quot;&gt;mission critical&lt;/a&gt;” to the client. The authors of Apprenticeship
Patterns (or AP for shortzies) talk a lot about building these toy
systems in &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big&quot;&gt;isolation&lt;/a&gt;, or private. I love this ‘pattern’ but, I
think there exists a better spin to the whole design in isolation idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Design in production&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all have &lt;a href=&quot;http://storieswritingadventure.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/damien_canderle_gremlins2.jpg&quot;&gt;little problems&lt;/a&gt; that could be easily solved,
quantified, or tracked using some kind of application. Focus that need
and build a breakable toy. It doesn’t have to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/503258b5aac422d76f000036/big&quot;&gt;complex&lt;/a&gt;, or even all
that great, just build it. Once it is finished, iterate by bringing
someone on to help its inevitable design wonkyness or just keep adding
features through user stories. The main verbs being: build, deploy,
iterate, test and perhaps most important of all: &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a/big&quot;&gt;break&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well…most important of all might go to actually reading AP. Really, read
the book, you can thank me later&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fuck The 80/20 Rule</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/20/Fuck-The-80-20/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/20/Fuck-The-80-20</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you know what all this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big&quot;&gt;80/20&lt;/a&gt; shit is about? If not feel free to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&quot;&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt; and be &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large&quot;&gt;enlightened&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t get me wrong, the rule works
real well when used in the vertical that is business. 80% of your
terrible experiences come from 20% of your customers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/n-mpifTiPV4&quot;&gt;I get it&lt;/a&gt;, I
really do. The problem lies when the 80/20 rule is used in this domain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will make 80% of my time perfect and the other 20 can be “whatever”,
or “meh”, or “shit”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People pull this &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big&quot;&gt;stunt&lt;/a&gt; with diets, excersise, getting things done,
everything. Again, I understand! No one is perfect and as you &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;approach
perfection, actual perfection becomes harder and harder to attain&lt;/a&gt;.
My &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f67e29ca154572000000/big&quot;&gt;beef&lt;/a&gt; with the idea stems from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random&quot;&gt;lazy factor&lt;/a&gt;. People, with
diligence and some elbow grease could iron out that unwieldy 20%
eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet they don’t. They idly stand by and watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f2bf29ca153c71000025/big&quot;&gt;life fly by them&lt;/a&gt;, all
while assuming what they are doing is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nypost.com/rw/nypost/2012/02/24/news/web_photos/24.1n008.gop--300x300.jpg&quot;&gt;A-OK&lt;/a&gt;. Since this is my blog
and apparently the way things are going these days, advice column, this
is a good way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;break out&lt;/a&gt; of the aforementioned
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;mediocrity&lt;/a&gt;…Don’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were beting on a list &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a&quot;&gt;weren’t you&lt;/a&gt;? Nope. If you are sucking
20% of the time today, suck 19% tomorrow. &lt;a href=&quot;http://media-files.gather.com/images/d336/d43/d746/d224/d96/f3/full.jpg&quot;&gt;Whittle&lt;/a&gt; away at it at
your own pace but, promise me, never be happy with the number 20.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing: butter sculptures will never count for the 20%&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/19/My-Take-On-Everything-August-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random&quot;&gt;Genuis&lt;/a&gt;! This post will be a rundown of all of the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;tech-shit&lt;/a&gt;
that has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big&quot;&gt;dominating&lt;/a&gt; the news for the past month. Most of the
items that will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/FHWMO&quot;&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt;(I know, most people despise them), will be
subjects that aren’t worth an entire post. Without further &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adodarts.com/&quot;&gt;ado&lt;/a&gt;, lets
get this rollin’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;appnet&quot;&gt;App.net&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have refrained from talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://join.app.net/&quot;&gt;Dalton&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large&quot;&gt;ridiculously&lt;/a&gt;
named “App.net” due to my “unnease” with the whole project. I am a huge
fan of Twitter yet, not what they are pulling at &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/16/twitter-drop-dead&quot;&gt;the moment&lt;/a&gt; with their
developers. After listening to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.70decibels.com/enough/&quot;&gt;few podcasts&lt;/a&gt; on the subject, the
fact that you can export all of your “updates” in plain-text is really
interesting. I could &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%20could%20give%20two%20shits&amp;amp;defid=6196142&quot;&gt;give two shits about&lt;/a&gt; moah characters (200 something),
lack of third party application support, or being the hip thing to do.
If App.net can deliver, I will throw my 50 dollars at them per year. It
may be a steap price but, it is worth it for the peace of mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ms-surface&quot;&gt;MS Surface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the people who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx&quot;&gt;don’t know&lt;/a&gt; (which is probably a good amount of
you). The keyboard is dumb, the prie point is unknown and it will run
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wpcentral.com/microsoft-banning-apps-metro-windows-8-store-windows-phone-next&quot;&gt;Metro&lt;/a&gt;…OOPs, probably going to get sued for that. Microsoft needs to
stick to what &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP&quot;&gt;they do best&lt;/a&gt; and forget about following
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomshardware.com/news/tablet-islate-ipad-netbook-notebook,9929.html&quot;&gt;trends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;facebook-stock&quot;&gt;Facebook Stock&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really? Who bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://jeffreyhill.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d417153ef017c31595837970b-800wi&quot;&gt;this stuff&lt;/a&gt;? Let it tank, and let the people who
thought they were buying into Google in 1998 go with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;apple-vs-samsung&quot;&gt;Apple VS Samsung&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone in their right mind knows to give the &lt;a href=&quot;http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi&quot;&gt;whole patent&lt;/a&gt; thing 0
percent of their time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fin&quot;&gt;Fin&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the fish!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cucumber 101</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/18/Cucumber-101/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/18/Cucumber-101</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know it is pretty fucking cliched; however, it is hard to go through a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubythreads.com/products/tatft&quot;&gt;Ruby day&lt;/a&gt; without some &lt;a href=&quot;http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random&quot;&gt;surious&lt;/a&gt; testing. That’s right, if you
don’t know what “TATFT” means than you haven’t been doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship&quot;&gt;craftsmen&lt;/a&gt;
level software development for all that long. In this post we are going
to take a newly formed [[Rails]] application and get it up to speed with
some simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://cukes.info/&quot;&gt;Cucumber&lt;/a&gt; style tests. In addition, this will be my
first software based post, which is kind of exciting…I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that needs to be done is cracking open that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;Gemfile&lt;/a&gt;
and let’s add in these lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ruby
group :test do
  gem &#39;cucumber-rails&#39;, :require =&amp;gt; false
  gem &#39;capybara-webkit&#39;
  gem &#39;database_cleaner&#39;
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/FHWMO&quot;&gt;those people&lt;/a&gt; who feel the need to place version
numbers in your Gemfile, go ahead. As an aside, I recommend NOT doing
this. Use your Gemfile.lock and your version control &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bundler&quot;&gt;du jour&lt;/a&gt; to
keep gem versions inline with your dev and production platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three gems you added into your Rails application are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[[Cucumber-rails]] adds all the requires into your app where needed. A
&lt;code&gt;rails g cucumber:install&lt;/code&gt; will also need to be run after bundle
installing the above gems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Database cleaner will cleanse your test environment after each test.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capybara-webkit is a handy gem for running &lt;code&gt;@javascript&lt;/code&gt; tagged tests
in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://images3.makefive.com/images/entertainment/books/top-5-harry-potter-characters/nearly-headless-nick-7.jpg&quot;&gt;headless environment&lt;/a&gt;. It does require you download/compile
QT-Webkit; however, this is a breeze with Homebrew (it is listed as
‘qt’)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you finnish installing QT (Tested on 10.8.0 @2012.08.18 and working
great) you should head over to &lt;code&gt;/railsAppRoot/features/support/env.rb&lt;/code&gt; and add in this
string:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ruby
Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And VOILA! You are ready to start testing! For a handy way to run
commands/tests, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://henican.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/scared-baby.jpg&quot;&gt;command line&lt;/a&gt; Vim and Tmux, read &lt;a href=&quot;http://henrik.nyh.se/2012/07/tests-on-demand-using-vimux-and-turbux-with-spork-and-guard/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;
by someone way smarter than myself. Keep your eyes peeled for another
post on Cucumber stories and how to write reusable yet sensible tests in
your Rails app.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2012-08-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/17/Do-Not-Raise-Your-Hand</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been spending the better part of the morning listenin’ to Ska. If
this directly affects the quality of this post, no &lt;a href=&quot;http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20120625/640/sweating_profusely_isnt_so_bad_640_04.jpg&quot;&gt;one cares&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

only &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/T5ictPToU9M&quot;&gt;assume are smahter than yourself&lt;/a&gt; (yes smart is spelled
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_accent#Vowels&quot;&gt;correctly&lt;/a&gt;), you freeze, lock up and choke under pressure. Nothing
like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfie&quot;&gt;these people though&lt;/a&gt; though…“colloquial term” &lt;strong&gt;LEVEL UP&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See! You are already a few steps ahead; however, you hold yourself back
because of some, or all of the below reasons (don’t hate, Friday may as
well be one &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/4f6692412f0aaaf647000004/big&quot;&gt;big list day&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, we are done here. A couple really sweet tips that have taken
me a long way that definitely couldn’t hurt. Check out a recent talk by
an awesome person named: &lt;a href=&quot;http://coreyhaines.com/&quot;&gt;Corey Haines&lt;/a&gt;. Its first run was while he was
visiting Steel City Ruby Conf in Pittsburgh this year. I could have
sworn Confreaks was there so keep refreshing until it shows up. It is
well worth the 30 minutes of your time. And, finally the moment that kareoke
machine is brought out, you be the first to the mike. Yep…win!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>15 Days In</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/16/15-Days-In/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-16T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/16/15-Days-In</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes-sir-ree-bob (I think that is how it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.raymondcostello.com/assets/images/autogen/a_Ray-_-Bob-Villa.jpg&quot;&gt;spelled&lt;/a&gt;) is the
coveted, and prehaps much unanticipated &lt;a href=&quot;http://robbwolf.com/&quot;&gt;mid-way-30-day&lt;/a&gt; challenge update.
Avoiding much &lt;a href=&quot;http://hooplawine.com/home&quot;&gt;hoopla&lt;/a&gt;, let’s get somewhat started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To say that the experience hasn’t been &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;hard&lt;/a&gt;, would be fairly
difficult. Depending who you are as an individual, you could easily find
30 minutes a day to bang out a somewhat short blog post. The hard part
mentioned is making them &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large&quot;&gt;coherent&lt;/a&gt;, funny, somewhat well-written and
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large&quot;&gt;digestable&lt;/a&gt;. The real rub comes in the creation of the content
though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi&quot;&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt; out a few posts after a single brain storming
session is far from difficult. Being able to consistently create content
day after day is. If you don’t open Vim (you &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckgo.com/?q=Vim+site%3Acloudbacon.com&quot;&gt;ARE using vim&lt;/a&gt; right?)
at the beginning of the day, then you are destined to waste a good
amount of time at night &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/FHWMO&quot;&gt;floundering&lt;/a&gt; through an otherwise shitty post.
This coupled with the above brain storming issue make &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt;
writing a post every day, somewhat difficult. Not impossible though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a plan for capturing post ideas on the fly (I utilize Omnifocus heavily for this task) and
starting the writing early on will make the overall experience 100.times better.
On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;whole&lt;/a&gt;, the experience has been a combination of agony,
happiness, bouts of uncontrollable smiling, and lots of equal (=) signs.
Yep, that good.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>iCloud VS Dropbox</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/15/iCloudyness-VS-Dropping-Things/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/15/iCloudyness-VS-Dropping-Things</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am well aware that there was a promise made to deliver on a half-way
point post about this whole 30 day challenge. However, this isn’t it. So
quit your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/187710&quot;&gt;bitchin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a few posts lately (mostly on those blogs that rake in
the real &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;dough&lt;/a&gt;) highlighting people’s usage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.tt/2xQgdve&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Me&quot;&gt;iCloud&lt;/a&gt;.
Both are great ways to sync data across &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.crackberry.com/files/kevin/storm2/blackberrystorm2overview.jpg&quot;&gt;multiple devices&lt;/a&gt; and both
seem to be “&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lenovo.com/images/uploads/hero/TopView_T430s_crop.jpg&quot;&gt;manageable&lt;/a&gt;” when staying within their &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/FHWMO&quot;&gt;free domain&lt;/a&gt;.
So they’re tools, free, and do the same thing; what makes them
different?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, Dropbox is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large&quot;&gt;rooted&lt;/a&gt; in the old-timey idea of a file
system. You, the user create &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Week&quot;&gt;obnoxiously deep&lt;/a&gt; folder structures to house
files you don’t really care about because the likely-hood of you
retrieving them through memory is slim at best. iCloud on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Your%20other%20right&amp;amp;defid=4815784&quot;&gt;other hand&lt;/a&gt; pulls all that shit away from the user and makes
syncing app related. This means that apps keep track of the files, not
some weird folder grouping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go into how I use iCloud (because frankly I use Dropbox like
everyone else: it is a cluster of folders that contain items I only
find on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;accident&lt;/a&gt;), I want you, the reader to understand that I am
very opinionated….k, thx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why use both? iCloud and its app specific file syncing makes it great
for keeping loose amounts of stuff around. Particuarly stuff from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dayoneapp.com/&quot;&gt;Day
One&lt;/a&gt; or any app that you might care little about. You can just chuck
shit in, and not worry about the way files are handled. This freedom
allows the writer to create without ever worrying if he/she will find it
again. I find it liberating. This idea of a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://yfiles.tumblr.com/post/28095580833/20-hours-with-mountain-lion&quot;&gt;flat file system&lt;/a&gt; is pretty fucking Genius, and I am rather
interested to see where Apple is going with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something awesome: RiserFS / BTRFS mixed with a flat system + git.
Fucking epic!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Note Cards For</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/14/Fun-Found-In-Notecards/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/14/Fun-Found-In-Notecards</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Uh, I know, another post on some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rlv.zcache.com/obey_sudo_card-p137691123849347174bh2r3_400.jpg&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/a&gt;(see what I did there) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large&quot;&gt;productivity&lt;/a&gt; ideal.
Don’t &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pakalertpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/8-suspicious-events-surrounding-the-Miami-zombie-attack.jpg&quot;&gt;fret&lt;/a&gt; too much, you have 15 or so more days left of it.
Moreover, you can very well bet your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.etsy.com/listing/96193234/britches&quot;&gt;britches&lt;/a&gt; that there will be
some kind of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gimmebar.com/view/502a845aaac422e922000005/big&quot;&gt;“half-way point”&lt;/a&gt; toot tomorrow instead of anything
remotely resembling nerdtastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right! &lt;a href=&quot;http://frictionless.bigcartel.com/product/capture-cards&quot;&gt;Note Cards&lt;/a&gt;! Or “Capture Cards”, as us &lt;strike&gt;un&lt;/strike&gt;productive fools like
to call them, are great for grabbing all the little things that come
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;flying by&lt;/a&gt;. Those items that &lt;a href=&quot;http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi&quot;&gt;bombard us&lt;/a&gt; so quickly that we
don’t have enough time to pull out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;iDevice&lt;/a&gt; but, we need to jot
them down due to their &lt;a href=&quot;http://productivity.stackexchange.com/questions/1236/how-to-discern-between-actionable-items-and-someday-maybe&quot;&gt;action-ability&lt;/a&gt;. There are two really great
aspects that make note cards indispensible in this manner:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.javaranch.com/journal/2003/04/immutable.htm&quot;&gt;mutable&lt;/a&gt; objects… Meaning they are easily discarded
and replaced. This simplicity allows them to be easily found, even if
you show up empty handed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are non-threatening. When people pull out their phones they
threaten the crowd with the fact that they (the crowd) are so boring
that you need to “check-in”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You didn’t think that you would get through a post on productivity
without some kind of list did you? Good. Because that is actually impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Number 4…ok, done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What tools are required for all this malarkey?&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/13/Groping-In-The-Dark</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There comes a time in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nextnature.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/tilapia-swimming-in-tank-530x397.jpg&quot;&gt;everyone’s lives&lt;/a&gt;, hopefully when they are
young, that they realize &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/T5ictPToU9M&quot;&gt;something is wrong&lt;/a&gt;. We all go through it
no matter who you are. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/tv/toddlers-tiaras&quot;&gt;Young&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://reidreport.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/murdoch.jpg&quot;&gt;old&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.cnn.com/2006-02-12/politics/cheney_1_katharine-armstrong-birdshot-saturday-afternoon-armstrong-ranch?_s=PM:POLITICS&quot;&gt;wealthy&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_and_Poors&quot;&gt;dirt poor&lt;/a&gt;.
We all go through a time of reflection that makes us question why and
what we are doing…well, except some of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people are petrified to question their life choices; however, they do
so because they quickly realize that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_American_entertainers&quot;&gt;everyone else has done it&lt;/a&gt;.
In addition, I used to be a punk rock fan so I understand about the whole “following
people thing”…and yes there are some times when it is warranted. Some
people call it the &lt;a href=&quot;http://undercurrentcoaching.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/glory-years.jpg&quot;&gt;quarter life crisis&lt;/a&gt;; however, it is just some
time in your twenties/early thirties where you “&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_FfZMBBaCF8w/SJdo-hpFfkI/AAAAAAAAB6Q/WD7et8UdAI4/s400/create.jpg&quot;&gt;begin to be&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of us go through it for longer periods than others and that is ok.
The biggest part being that it occurs. What I have witnessed lately is a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time&quot;&gt;metric fuck-ton&lt;/a&gt; of mid-20 year olds in such a &lt;a href=&quot;http://voices.yahoo.com/todays-youth-generation-blue-ribbon-winners-148076.html&quot;&gt;coddled state&lt;/a&gt;
that they completely miss out. Besides raising a bunch of
softy-philosophers (I have no beef with hard ass philosophers), we are
stuck with a group of people who believe…like for fucking real, this
statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;all his life he was told that he wanted in life would come to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to sub out “him” with “her” or “&lt;a href=&quot;http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/173/a/d/Cousin_IT_by_Nastyguy.jpg&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;” in the above sentence.
I recommend taking a firm stance with these people. Read Manga in the
nude, in your living room, talk to yourself loudly at night, save your
urine. Just something to snap them out of their haze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck, this makes me &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/4r7wHMg5Yjg&quot;&gt;sound like one of these guys&lt;/a&gt;….&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Chaos Development</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/12/Pen-And-Pencil/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/12/Pen-And-Pencil</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When you start a project of any kind do you start by typing something
into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.ytimg.com/vi/JYY2yj7B5cE/0.jpg&quot;&gt;terminal&lt;/a&gt; or do you begin on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fieldnotesbrand.com/&quot;&gt;piece of paper&lt;/a&gt;? Many
developers probably start by typing some stuff out but rarely, perhaps
like our &lt;a href=&quot;http://designers.mx/post/list/everyone/all&quot;&gt;designer brethren&lt;/a&gt;, do we begin with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paddlepalace.com/&quot;&gt;analog tools&lt;/a&gt;.
Why? Is it because developers feel more at home with a bunch of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lenovo.com/images/uploads/hero/TopView_T430s_crop.jpg&quot;&gt;chicklet keys&lt;/a&gt; or do we generally have no use for sketching
features out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is definitely a place for a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-Gel-Ink-Pens/ct/284&quot;&gt;pen&lt;/a&gt; and piece of &lt;a href=&quot;http://doanepaper.com/&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; in the
beginning and subsequent phases of software dev. Perhaps not to sketch
things out logically but, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/n-mpifTiPV4&quot;&gt;chaotically&lt;/a&gt; write features everywhere. Jot
down table names, feature ideas, needed gems, future plans, whatever.
The only rule being, never stay within the lines!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_dotPad.shtml&quot;&gt;notebook&lt;/a&gt; that is layed out in a dot-grid or a traditional
line grid. This alone absolves the need to write everything down on a
line starting from the left and moving to the right. You can start
anywhere, and go anywhere which leaves your brain free to jot down
anything and add to it later. This type of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rlv.zcache.com/freedumb_tshirt-p235916646013340812enwjh_210.jpg&quot;&gt;freedom&lt;/a&gt; is much more
constrained when it comes to interacting with text using just a keyboard
and mouse (yes, I am making an assumption that you don’t have a fancy
Cintiq).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ability to be chaotic is priceless and something that should be
cultivated during the entire &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;life-cycle&lt;/a&gt; of any “software project”.
If you have never thought about grabbing a piece of paper and writing
out things, give it a whirl. If you happen to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthexpertadvice.org/forum/Allergies/Allergic-to-toilet-paper-40038.htm&quot;&gt;allergic to
paper&lt;/a&gt;…well, then maybe take this advice with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Run some tests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Switch to a Rails controller, view, or model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search through a list of files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Search through a list of buffers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open a command to be piped to a specific tmux window&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open a visual tree-list of all files in the current director&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Being Healthy And A Programmer</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/11/Being-Healthy-And-A-Programmer/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-11T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/11/Being-Healthy-And-A-Programmer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OH yes sir(and/or/maybe mam), it is completely doable. Since the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkmovie.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Tron-Legacy3.jpg&quot;&gt;dawn of
the programmer&lt;/a&gt;, we have been portrayed as fairly &lt;a href=&quot;http://tubulocity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/fat_cyclist.jpg&quot;&gt;portly&lt;/a&gt; dweebs
who exist in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/sitting-kills/&quot;&gt;chronic sitting position&lt;/a&gt;. While this has been true
in the past, and surely is at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://diabetic-calendar.com/&quot;&gt;moment&lt;/a&gt; (who the fuck would even purchase a diabetic calendar - tres bizarre), we can do a lot to help
ourselves stay healthy while still doing what we &lt;a href=&quot;http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi&quot;&gt;absolutely love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.lenovo.com/images/uploads/hero/TopView_T430s_crop.jpg&quot;&gt;Change is hard&lt;/a&gt;(it really is sad about Lenovo moving to chicklet stylz), especially when it comes to the food we shove in our
&lt;a href=&quot;http://wildomarmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/shut_your_pie_hole.jpg&quot;&gt;pie-holes&lt;/a&gt;. However, programmers are accustom to change. They pivot
constantly, change their working environments and generally don’t have a
problem with this…right? Keeping this easy then, let’s just stop
eating carbohydates and sugar. Pretty easy huh?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No carbs and no sugars means no &lt;a href=&quot;http://punchfork.com/recipes/spaghetti%20squash&quot;&gt;spaghetti&lt;/a&gt;, pasta, bread, muffins,
cakes, any of it. To make this transition easy, follow this rule six out
of seven days in the week (one day off). Ok, so why right? Well sugar
and carbs force your pancreas to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/481929-increased-blood-sugar-weight-gain/&quot;&gt;produce a lot of insulin&lt;/a&gt; which
will inevitably lead to diabetes and weight gain. Both of these things,
if you are lost, are bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it? Yep! Well…actually, give a &lt;a href=&quot;http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk&quot;&gt;standing desk&lt;/a&gt; a whirl.
They can be hard to get used to; however, are great for your posture,
back strength, legs, etc in the long run. If you are worried about
standing all day (it is hard at first) find one that auto-magically
moves up and down. They are expensive but will add years onto the
backend of your life in order for you to continue to do what you love
well into your old age. Go &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)&quot;&gt;forth&lt;/a&gt; and be a healthy, kick-ass
programmer!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Current Workflows</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/10/2012-Workflows/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-10T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/10/2012-Workflows</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, rule number one (don’t use “&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense&quot;&gt;of thumb&lt;/a&gt;”), avoid trying to jump
people away from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://punchfork.com/recipes/meat%20and%20potatos&quot;&gt;meat-and-potatoes&lt;/a&gt; of a blog post before they even
start reading. AKA the link in the summary field, did you even click it?
Why not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hack at my workflows almost constantly. If it isn’t reading,
or programming, you can bet that I am looking to do something way &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;better
than yesterday.&lt;/a&gt; Since this post will end up being a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; (hey, they
are super easy to write), most of the workflow will be center around
gui applications and not my overall crack-addiction to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface&quot;&gt;CLI&lt;/a&gt;.
Without, further &lt;a href=&quot;http://billdaviswords.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/nothing-to-say-so-blog.gif&quot;&gt;ado&lt;/a&gt;, be prepared for &lt;a href=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uWWqnrjrBzY/T663Ukikk6I/AAAAAAAACzg/0vV_K9qYbZk/wisdom-be-fearful-of-mediocrity.jpg&quot;&gt;negative-mediocrity&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yes, I run all of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigweek.co/&quot;&gt;big ticket&lt;/a&gt; applications in Lion and
Mountain Lion’s full screen mode. These are generally Chrome Canary,
Iterm2, and OmniFocus…sometimes Rdio. This also means that I
&lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; use a double monitor setup. I find them distracting and
overall a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/&quot;&gt;UX clusterfuck&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am an &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmonad&quot;&gt;Xmonad&lt;/a&gt; freak and wish there was something more like it
available for the OS X. To get around this I use a launcher named
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;. Alfred has an extension named &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.jga.me/layouts/&quot;&gt;layouts&lt;/a&gt; to control
your windows and I assign cmd + option + # to apps I want to switch
to quickly. This means that if I want to quickly navigate to Chrome,
I can hit cmd + option + 2 instead of command-tabing there or using
the mouse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vim (&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-07-Leave-Macvim-To-The-Noobz&quot;&gt;NOT FUCKING MACVIM&lt;/a&gt;) + Tmux for &lt;a href=&quot;http://us13.memecdn.com/finish-him_gp_205003.jpg&quot;&gt;combo&lt;/a&gt; awesome-sauce.
This allows 1 iTerm2 window to stay open in full screen (with only
two “iTerm” style tabs: tmux + bitlbee/irc server for chatting)
and act as many different terminals through the power inherent in Tmux. In addition, some people seem to
have a-beef with Tmux’s copy and paste mode…&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard&quot;&gt;I don’t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nial.me/2011/12/houdini-to-appear-in-the-mac-app-store/&quot;&gt;Houdini&lt;/a&gt; is a free app that will hide away inactive items when a
certain time limit is hit. The idea being that you have one constant,
clean workspace. You cmd+tab(I use tab+q because those two items are generally close) to an app that isn’t important enough to
be full screen (thereby taking up a workspace) but, something you want
to use later. This keeps the one “open” workspace free and
clear of open/front-facing/distracting apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is a little much to take in so if you have any questions hit
me up on the Twitters. Overall though, it works fairly well, the only
thing that I wish for was a smart window tiling manager, ala Xmonad.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tylerwm.com/&quot;&gt;Tyler&lt;/a&gt; seems like a good option for this; however, it doesn’t seem
to function on Mountain Lion and it is long-in-the-tooth when it comes
to a substantial upgrade…We shall see.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2012-08-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/09/Delivering-Happiness</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yeah, why the fuck &lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mcMJ_B_hD0U/TKhNgFPsQWI/AAAAAAAAAR8/ZAtFQwauQvg/s1600/archer.jpg&quot;&gt;not&lt;/a&gt;? How have we gotten to the point where we
simply accept &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidforbes.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ie-devil_03.jpg&quot;&gt;shitty software&lt;/a&gt; (although I hear number 10 is way
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inspireux.com/wp-content/uploads/310.gif&quot;&gt;good&lt;/a&gt;)? Do you get all giddy when you sit down in the morning and
turn on Outlook and Office? I happen to work with several of &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn1.benzinga.com/files/crazypeople.jpg&quot;&gt;these
peoples&lt;/a&gt; and all I hear &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;spew from their mouths&lt;/a&gt; each morning are
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Groan-Up-Newark-Nebraska-ebook/dp/B005OC2V8I/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1344561738&amp;amp;sr=8-5&amp;amp;keywords=groan+up&quot;&gt;groans&lt;/a&gt;(I swear it is sorta a true story).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah…well, again, why the &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; do people ship anything but happiness?
Is it hard, sure but, why on earth would you go through the trouble for a
few quick bucks? And, guarenteed it will be a measly few. People usually
don’t contine to buy shitty software if it continues to exude shit…
Wait, no that’s not right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and basically everything they make. It is defined
by how much hapiness it &lt;a href=&quot;http://thisthatandtheotherthang.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/funny-pictures-kitten-and-puppy-watch-a-scary-movie-together.jpg&quot;&gt;sucks from people&lt;/a&gt; and yet people continue
to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nataliedee.com/051209/FUN-FACT-i-use-that-shit-to-wash-my-face.jpg&quot;&gt;use this shit&lt;/a&gt; without question. How do we fix this? Just fucking
stop building shitty things and pump the market with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time&quot;&gt;fuck-ton&lt;/a&gt; of
happiness. Because, really? What else is needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologize for the lack of love in these posts lately. I need to
stretch their formation out over the day (VS when I get home from it) and hope it solves this
issue. No guarentees promised, pre-haps a little bit of alcohol is all
that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Distrust The Magic</title>

   <updated>2012-08-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/08/Always-Distrust-The-Magic</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you spend enough time working with computers there is a good chance
you might &lt;a href=&quot;http://tremendousnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/drunk-urinal.jpg&quot;&gt;stumble&lt;/a&gt; onto some &lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GTXZyOmzHaA/TfHMTu4JfOI/AAAAAAAAAzo/BQ7pgmBblno/s1600/finkle_630x_2.jpg&quot;&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. This doesn’t mean that you
might randomly see unicorns while tracking down your next &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.airtime.com/&quot;&gt;porn-s-cipade&lt;/a&gt;,
frankly this is normal. No, the magic that will be reamed on, neglected,
yelled at, and belabored for the rest of this post is that of utter
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hovding.com/en/how&quot;&gt;deception&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programmers are really good at hiding away all the hard things in this
magic. They wrap it up in little quiant boxes, with buttons and
checkboxes that…“just work.” We see this with Windows Server.
Everything is just a click away, all along while the user has no idea
how to actually &lt;strong&gt;DO&lt;/strong&gt; any of it. In their mind they build a network of
roads, all of which lead to desired solutions. We don’t know how the
roads are leveled, what goes into the mixture, how they are laid, etc.
We just know how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://berkutschi.com/assets/images/news/000/005/334/thumb500/nor_velta.jpg?1342704744&quot;&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt;, wrapped in an duck all shoved into a
wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://supershopsite.com/product_image/Pet/merrick-turducken-dog-food-case-of-24-55oz-cans.jpg&quot;&gt;enema&lt;/a&gt;. This cripples us. We don’t understand how any of
the underlying items fuction or how they interact with each other to
&lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; make something work. Rails, Windows, OS X, all of it should
be rooted through, explored, tested, and ultimately broken. Set up
environments, test, test, test, and more important than anything:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;attempt to do your worst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a really complex topic, one that can’t be put to justice with
just one post. The plan? Extrapolate the magic further and smatter it
throughout a couple more posts. Come back tomorrow…or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/07/Leave-Macvim-To-The-Noobz</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If it wasn’t painfully obvious from my &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt;, I spent the better
half of the first weekend of August, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://steelcityrubyconf.org/&quot;&gt;a Ruby conference&lt;/a&gt;. The one
topic that I was fairly positive would &lt;a href=&quot;http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1161/953433678_f1cdac15f5.jpg&quot;&gt;creep up&lt;/a&gt;, yet somehow
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.officialpsds.com/images/thumbs/Care-Bears-psd38826.png&quot;&gt;magically flew away&lt;/a&gt;, was the “editor talk.” No one was comparing
their Vim configs to people’s lowly Textmate installs. No Emacs vs
Sublime Text 2, nothing really. Damn shame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did show it’s face, was people’s love of Sublime Text 2. Wait for the
cmd-tab, wait for it…wait. BOOM! Sublime Text. If it wasn’t ST2, then
it was the dreaded MacVim; hater-instiling that you forcibly cmd-tab (that is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lh4.ggpht.com/-jMFKFfLHVjY/UCDVwf66tlI/AAAAAAAAD5I/DdnlV635SWY/this%252520keyboard%252520is%252520not%252520quite%252520in%252520my%252520reach%25252017%252520June.jpg&quot;&gt;fucking reach&lt;/a&gt;) everywhere.
MacVim users probably silently wish that they could cmd-tab through their
legs to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a97173_g114_4-ny.jpg&quot;&gt;speed up their walking pace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff&quot;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt; told us that opinions (he used the word “tastes”) would &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/2011-05-10-why-the-lucky-stiff-quote&quot;&gt;begin to
define&lt;/a&gt; us over what we created; however, I draw the line at being
defined by how many times I can cmd-tab faster than the next person. To
help all of you cmd-tab loving folks (I have fucked my cmd-tab seo on
this post), here is a list of really cool things to get you back into
terminal Vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a look at updating OS X’s default version with this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbacon.com/2012-07-03-Vim-Can-Suck&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Being at the terminal level allows you to &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; cmd-tab to it. This
in itself will speed you up tremendously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download and use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxcertif.com/man/1/tmux/&quot;&gt;tmux&lt;/a&gt;. It has a learning curve but is well
worth it for when you start pair programming and as a damn-good
terminal multiplexer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Seriously, download and use tmux. It can be found and installed via
brew and you can even &lt;a href=&quot;http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux&quot;&gt;buy a book about it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If this is your first &lt;a href=&quot;http://teamsteevo.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/fail-owned-cow-curiosity-fail.jpg&quot;&gt;rodeo&lt;/a&gt;, find a great set of defaults,
either through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carlhuda/janus&quot;&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles&quot;&gt;Yadr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read through what the above config files do, test and try every last
section&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.thoughtbot.com/vim&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, read it all. They are way smarter than I am and always
have great blog posts on developmenty things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it two weeks. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/&quot;&gt;Close MacVim&lt;/a&gt;, find a terminal that you can
stand, download tmux and give your new-found freedom a whirl. Then send
me a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/braidn&quot;&gt;message&lt;/a&gt; on the Twitters and tell me how it is going.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>3 Things</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/06/3-things/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/06/3-things</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Due to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubyrogues.com/rr-60-solid-with-jim-weirich/&quot;&gt;abnormal size&lt;/a&gt; of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://i51.tinypic.com/2135flx.jpg&quot;&gt;cranial hair follicals&lt;/a&gt;, it has been
deemed illegal to wear &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.askaprice.com/res/images/articles/cycle-helmet-female_299x403.jpg&quot;&gt;items on my head&lt;/a&gt; in the great state of &lt;a href=&quot;http://parislemon.com/post/28600694849/wired-apple-is-building-something-new-at-its&quot;&gt;North
Carolina&lt;/a&gt;. Lots of folks also have a problem with “where in the world” North Carolina
is so I think a picture of an Apple data center should help out.
Regardless of, this entire post is not about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jockew/4636027374/sizes/l/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;facial hair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seofaction.com/images/postgres.jpg&quot;&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt;
(like the one from Postgres), or North Carolina. Nope, it is actually a list.
A list of three passion-things to be exact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our puny brains have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckgo.com/?q=multitasking+iz+bad&quot;&gt;hard time doing a lot of things at once&lt;/a&gt;. The
more we attempt to focus on, the worse and worse everything seems to get
around us. This is why I am advocating the idea of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;3 Things&lt;/a&gt;.”
Factor everything you do down into just three things and you will find
yourself free and clear to focus and dominate whatever three you choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s not be too harsh though. What I am not advocating is throwing away
your sense of adventure and settle. Explore, find things that are
fearful, scary, fun, gas-y, etc and when you do find something that you
want to add to your three list, do so with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/xP1-oquwoL8&quot;&gt;fervor unmatched by anyone&lt;/a&gt;!
Over time you will begin to hone skills that are integral to succeeding
at your three chosen passions. As time ticks by, you might sub out one
passion for another; however, make sure that you simply table your skill
sets, never throw them away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of all! Write them down so your puny brain doesn’t forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My Wife: understanding her, loving her, being there when I am needed.
Although the whole partner thing is hard it is well worth it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programming: A field I find myself in love with more and more every
LOC that is written.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crossfit: High pain tolerance, focus, and a never retreat
attitude is rarely prized in sports. I am glad something like this
exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple. Write down and dive into yours right now!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>30 Minute Tarcks</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/05/30-Minutes/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/05/30-Minutes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be an uneducated &lt;a href=&quot;https://peepcode.com/&quot;&gt;peep&lt;/a&gt; who doesn’t quite grok the
idea of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikibin.org/articles/tarck-bike.html&quot;&gt;“tarck”&lt;/a&gt;…well, then I can’t help you. However, for the
remainder of this post tarck won’t be used in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://derper.com/images/derp/Have_You_Ever_Herped_So_Hard_You_Derped_.jpg&quot;&gt;bikez&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was the last day of a truly awesome Ruby convention in Pittsburgh
(pronounced “Pittz-burf” by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/brandonburke&quot;&gt;someone&lt;/a&gt; potentially brilliant) dubbed:
Steel City Ruby Conf. Otherwise known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.delphiforums.com/JITRBUG/scrc239logo.jpg&quot;&gt;“SCRC”&lt;/a&gt;. Of which I
thought was a motorcycle group, but as always, it is good to be wrong. At
this conference, along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://grok.cc/&quot;&gt;Greenville&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://drwaww7dh1loc.cloudfront.net/learning_preview/14305/image/large_grok.jpg&quot;&gt;Grok&lt;/a&gt; the focus was put
on the 30 minute inbetween sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meant that although the speaker line up was potentially insane at
SCRC, the organizers put a &lt;a href=&quot;http://developingux.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/solid_thumb.jpg&quot;&gt;large amount of weight&lt;/a&gt; on the
human interaction between the talks. I find there to be a few problems
with this model, especially in light of the kind of people who are in
attendance at a &lt;strike&gt;bro&lt;/strike&gt;programmer conference…we are mostly awkward OK! So why
force us into a 30 minute “mingle tarcks” with no Internet, little
coffee, and definitely NO beer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;challenging&lt;/a&gt; yourself to meet people at conferences is a terrible way
to go through something potentially awesome. However, forcing people
into these (30 minute &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamesprays.com/images/icons/icon_54.jpg&quot;&gt;tarcks&lt;/a&gt;) isn’t going to lead to anything
impressive. Yes, a few intermission &lt;a href=&quot;http://sfappeal.com/alley/images/WatermelonsGoneWild.jpg&quot;&gt;tarcks&lt;/a&gt; are great. We as nerds should be ripped from
the confort of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&amp;amp;pid=pdkb400bn&quot;&gt;mechanical keyboards&lt;/a&gt; and Aeron chairs and
forced to interact with other like minded fools. It is just 100% more
productive when a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Papst%20Blue%20Ribbon&quot;&gt;lubricant&lt;/a&gt; is involved. This could include mini
coding sessions, pairing games for future hackathons, tiny code
challenges, beer drinking, anything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping these times open and only for 30 minutes makes us realize how
little we can dive into a person’s life (if they even let us), before we
are ushered back to another talk. The moral? If you are starting a
conference, think long and hard about the mingle tarcks. They are
&lt;em&gt;invaluable&lt;/em&gt;; however, if poorly managed, a definite: stagnant
nightmare. Be brilliant and &lt;strong&gt;assist&lt;/strong&gt; in the breeding of said genius.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How To Think Like A Vimer</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/04/How-To-Think-Like-A-Vimmer/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/04/How-To-Think-Like-A-Vimmer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;SO this post isn’t going to help all of you Textmate, Textmate2,
SublimeText, emacs, or nano nerds out there. Nope, it is just for the
good ole folks who have their shit together and use the wonder that is
Vi or Vim. I haven’t written a whole lot on the subject in a while;
however, plan on something a little more &lt;a href=&quot;http://picturesofpeoplescanningqrcodes.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;noob&lt;/a&gt; friendly sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you pick up a piece of actual paper, you know the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.inhabitots.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/halloween1.jpg&quot;&gt;scary stuff&lt;/a&gt;
that exists in real life, do you think of how you build your sentences?
Moreover, do you think about how to navigate back through them if you
need to &lt;a href=&quot;http://sale.images.woot.com/Illiterate_RainbowjiuDetail.png&quot;&gt;edit&lt;/a&gt; anything when you are finished? I am going to go out
on a limb and say that most people have never &lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oByir_N-0rI/Tkaq3pX44_I/AAAAAAAAk-I/QJBS12_973o/s640/Marcus.png&quot;&gt;expired&lt;/a&gt; one thought
on these concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? When it comes to the bulk of our verbal creation these days, we are sitting on
a computer and we need to navigate in between a myriad of
lines and words to edit whatever we are working on. If this is true, why
don’t we take the time to sit down and think of the most effective way
to get from point A to point B? Here is a test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit down at your computer and pull up(in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;editor-du jour&lt;/a&gt;)
some prose&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Look at how the editor structures the text, look at the line breaks,
the spacing, how many words are placed on a line, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the cursor anywhere on the page, this will be your start point&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find a place that needs editing, maybe it is a misspelled word, bad
punctuation, whatever&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lasty, figure out how to get there &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; using the mouse and
with as &lt;strong&gt;few keystrokes&lt;/strong&gt; as humanly possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how a vimer &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.quotesnsayings.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Finding-Out-That-Someone-Does-The.png&quot;&gt;does it&lt;/a&gt;. Also I am not too sure it is “Vimer”
or “Vimmer”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cocks At A Conference</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/03/Cocks-At-Conferences/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/03/Cocks-At-Conferences</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I admit it, I am kind of bad at this whole conference scene thing. I love
meeting people but most of the time they force themselves into talking
points instead of bringing things up naturaly. Of course this will
happen due to the large amount of people interacting with each other
over a short amount of time. We just aren’t that skilled, nerd or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the hallway track which often turns into the simple “toot toot”, you have the random person that can’t keep their face out of their
laptop or scribbling on their iPad…Therebye, giving-up said: toot-toot factor.
Asshats basically, lots and lots of Asshats. Close that shit, get the twinky out of your mouth,
listen to the presenter and quit being a fuckup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all why on earth are you at this conference? To tick off some
imaginary box for a raise? Why are you programming? Go ahead, ask yourself that
NOW. It’s free and maybe you can write the file down on your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I said that there would be some fun links included in these
posts. So why is this one so angry…and dry you might ask? Well for
starters I severely dislike this type of a person and this exact file
was finished from my phone at 11:45 pm tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>30 Day Blogging Challenge</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/02/30-Days-of-Blogging/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/08/02/30-Days-of-Blogging</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;THROWDOWN! What the fuck am I thinking with all of this? Anyway some of the
readers might have seen a &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;influx&lt;/a&gt; of posts in their feed with this blog
over the past couple of days. What is happening is a blog posting will be
performed each and every day for 30 whole days or 26 &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time&quot;&gt;metric days&lt;/a&gt; (whichever way you swing).
I am sure I have tried this before but, I always seem to fall short on the 9th day.
Well folks, this time it is going to be different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strike&gt;Mission&lt;/strike&gt;
&lt;p&gt;no, wait &lt;strike&gt;delegation&lt;/strike&gt;…hmm.
Operation. No that’s all wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the idea will be to generate some sort of useful tidbit, hack,
Ruby code, workflow, piece of awesome, or something every day until
September 1st. All of the wacky linking will be provided free of charge. So make damn sure to
click as many links as possible in a futile attempt to figure out what
is going on in my rat trap of a brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prize for all of this you might ask? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&amp;amp;pid=pdkb400bn&quot;&gt;A Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2&lt;/a&gt;.
Yes, I have been looking at picking one up for a long time and need a
chellenge of this proportion to offset the cost of that sexy, sexy
keyboard. Until tomorrow…also some general rules are below!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-challenge-rules&quot;&gt;30 Day Challenge Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There must be a post for every day in August no matter how many days
actually exist in the month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each “Post” must be over 200 character-words to be considered
&lt;a href=&quot;http://chzmemebase.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/internet-memes-lets-take-the-law.jpg&quot;&gt;legal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each post has eggsactly 24 hours to be relevant (posts must be posted
to Heroku between 12:01 am and 11:59 pm)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything must be brilliant&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posts may not be written under the influence of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theonion.com/articles/chickfila-debuts-new-homophobic-sandwich,28888/&quot;&gt;God Chicken&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wait you, the reader, weren’t aware I loved the little elegant and

written in 2007; however, still packed with some pretty great
&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;nuggets&lt;/a&gt;. In particular, Russ Olson does a magnificent job of
summing up Ruby in the first chapter. If you are an accomplished &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Craftsmanship&quot;&gt;software

   <title>Slobbering MakeUp on a Pig</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/07/31/Pigs-Eating-MakeUp/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-31T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/07/31/Pigs-Eating-MakeUp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story&lt;/strong&gt;: My wife and I were cooking dinner one night (actually I had
returned from the gym and was generally being a nuisance) and a friend
asked to use the frying pan to cook his steak after we had finished. I
said that I had one more thing to cook and I would just throw the steak
on when I was done. At first he mulled this around in his head and then
gave me this response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nah, I want to sear the steak really quickly and try and lock in
the…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pretty much gave up listening after that. The gist being that he had
devised a very elaborate plan to cook his steak. This is great, a young
man having an opinion and a plan on how he/she was going to cook their
dinner. Except for one very interesting thing: The meat was purchased at
&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Lion&quot;&gt;Food Lion&lt;/a&gt;. If you weren’t in the know, Food Lion sells the
bottom-of-the-shit-barrel produce and meat. So what does all of this
equate to? You guessed it! Putting lipstick on a pig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview&quot;&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; is doing this these days with the anoucement and
inevitable fail that is Windows 8. A mediocre product slabbed with a
coat of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikihow.com/Paint-Your-Toe-Nails&quot;&gt;coral paint&lt;/a&gt; is still…wait for it: a FUCKING MEDIOCRE
product. As a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;reader&lt;/a&gt; you can sub out the word ‘product’ with
people, pigs, jobs, or anything really. This all relates to one simple fact:
&lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; has ever won a race being mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Colours Matter</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/07/05/Colors-Matter/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/07/05/Colors-Matter</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So what did everyone do yesterday (4th of July) instead of blow shit up
and drink too much beer? Unfortunatly an hour of work turned into three
wrestling with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;Tmux&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the way information is presented
on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/tmux4.jpg&quot;&gt;lower bar&lt;/a&gt;…or whatever it is called. Afterwards, I had a
conversation with my roommate concerning what we had done during the day
for “work.” When we concluded, he made a snippy joke about
“leaving me to my colored text.” For a second (just a hot one) I realized that he was perhaps
right in the sense that I was pissing my day away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His comment, unlike normal,  stuck with me
through the rest of the day. Through fireworks, copious amounts of beer,
Crossfit chit chat, everything really. The thing is, when we are forced
to do work with tools &lt;a href=&quot;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/home&quot;&gt;that we don’t enjoy&lt;/a&gt;, our work begins to
reflect our &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;attitude&lt;/a&gt;. It seeps into every little nook and cranny and it
infects us. Often-times in ways that we could never begin to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cope we turn to things that might infuse us with happiness. We look for solace in
Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and especially buying needless amounts of
shit. These passive forms of consumption lead us to nothing. I struggled
through the last sentence and decided to sub out everything because
there is no way to sugar-coat the fact. Unbridled consumption &lt;strong&gt;IS&lt;/strong&gt; what is making us
as a group of people weak, incoherent, short sighted, antsy, ignorant
and even a little…or a lot on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lG2az5ut9w0/Sw91s3I42zI/AAAAAAAAESA/1Ly8c1PdJEM/s400/+When_Breasts_Grow_On_Back_01.jpg&quot;&gt;pudgy side&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I may have wasted a good part of 3 hours hacking on “coloured
text,” I learned a lot about how Tmux works under the hood, and,
this is a biggy, I built &lt;a href=&quot;http://pinterest.com/search/?q=cabin+porn&quot;&gt;a space&lt;/a&gt; that I love to be in. Who knows
what will happen in a few minutes, in a few days or even in a few
months. What I know now is I will continue to build kick-ass, elegant software for people
who demand it because my working environment is great…cue &lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b9Y6zR4LXUw/TdFioigALEI/AAAAAAAAJqM/eyAxRKF8LCU/s1600/Funny-Tony-The-Tiger.jpg&quot;&gt;Tony&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, although I am “American”, I actually spell the word: colour
correctly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster&quot;&gt;Webster&lt;/a&gt; performed an egregious disservice to the English
language and I will never forgive him for his folly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vim Can Suck</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/07/03/Vim-Can-Suck/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/07/03/Vim-Can-Suck</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OS X is generally a wonderful operating system. Sure there are plenty of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17phrnpizopotjpg/original.jpg&quot;&gt;neckbeards&lt;/a&gt; out there that would love to punch me in the balls for the
comment. On the opposite side of life, most designers would agree with
me down to the fact that they demand that all the fiddly buttons
are actually “&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;lickable&lt;/a&gt;.” Whatever that means. Several items both of
these camps should be able to agree on is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Package management is hard on OS X&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and lots of Apple’s built in “stuff” (you might call them apps but,
you would &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system&quot;&gt;be wrong in doing so&lt;/a&gt;) kinda
blow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happen to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbacon.com/posts/2011-12-20-Command-T-Sucks/&quot;&gt;very opinionated&lt;/a&gt; Vim user and over the past month
have experienced…issues with the version of Vim compiled through the
nice folks at Apple. Before we continue, there are some clerifications
that are due. The Vim I am banging on about isn’t &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/macvim/&quot;&gt;MacVim&lt;/a&gt; or the Vim that
is bundled within the /Contents section of the MacVim install.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My biggest beef stems from the fact that the version bundled with Lion,
Snow Leopard, Leopard, Tiger, and probably all the way back to 10.1 are compiled without Ruby and Python support. This can cause
several issues with popular plugins like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wincent.com/products/command-://wincent.com/products/command-t&quot;&gt;Command-t&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sjl.bitbucket.org/gundo.vim/&quot;&gt;Gundo&lt;/a&gt; thereby rendering them useless when composing text. &lt;em&gt;READ&lt;/em&gt;:
they don’t fucking work. Being a short bus ride away from Canada day -
America, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;4th of July&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it appropriate to write a short
“how-to” in order to save potentially-awesome folk from this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, one more thing I am opinionated about is: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;.
Seriously, if you use MacPorts, Fink, or whatever other piece of
ancient package manager-shit, you have issues that will eventually equate to
your downfall. In addition, I am not much of a fan of Homebrew’s stance
on not offering packages that “Duplicate functionality provided by OS X.”
Enter: brew taps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get this started we are going to assume you have Homebrew installed
and every thing is up to date. Hop back into a terminal and type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
brew install mercurial
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cloudbacon.com/posts/2011-04-18-wordpress_to_ruby/&quot;&gt;didn’t like it either&lt;/a&gt; but so is life. Next:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
brew tap homebrew/dupes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agree to what it asks and make sure that your bashrc or zshrc file has
this path near the top&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
export PATH=&quot;/usr/local/bin:$PATH&quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have Homebrew set up to install system duplicate packages. Before
we set up Vim we need to switch back to the system compiled Ruby instead
of what we have set in Rbenv or RVM. Once that is done, life is a snap:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
brew install homebrew/dupes/vim
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretically &lt;code&gt;brew install vim&lt;/code&gt; will function nicely however, it is
always good to be explicit. If you would like to know some other
packages that fall into the realm of “dupes”, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes&quot;&gt;Github
repo&lt;/a&gt;. I have been using the Homebrew installed version all morning and by far it is faster and
more stable than what comes with Lion…DAMN you OS X for being so
brilliant and lacking at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Something In The Air Stinks</title>

   <updated>2012-06-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/06/08/Something-In-The-Air-Stinks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And we have reached another proverbial Friday, although mark my
words, I am not counting. I think. First of all, there needs to be a
good amount of explanation concerning the fascination with these “Friday
posts”. However, I would like to make an astute observation before I move on. The
keyboard on this 17 MBP is absolute shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my plan with these Friday rants is to really just try and sum up
a small segment of the week. Whether it be the state of political
affairs like last Friday, or perhaps something crushing about the local
field mouse population. Nothing very heavy, just something that will
make you giggle on a Friday afternoon…when you are probably
drunk and flipping through your RSS reader because you are alone due to
the fact that you know what RSS is. So without further ado, here we go:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that America has finally found itself a suitable and fitting

That’s right &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/4awVqRr1eCo&quot;&gt;another zombie attack&lt;/a&gt; was
chronicled this week in yet another, hopeless Southern State. No, go
ahead and take a wild guess. &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/8vuZ8jSVNUI&quot;&gt;Yup&lt;/a&gt; that’s right the great state of
Lousiana and all of it’s possible zombie infested inhabitants…welcome
to the danger zone. Best part? Yeah, apparently bath salts, when used
correctly have the potential to throw homeless people into a state of
“excited delirium and dangerous behavior”. Frankly, those are two
emotions…or whatever, that I wouldn’t want to explore while in a bath
tub. Moral behind all of these attacks? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motivationals.org/demotivational-posters/demotivational-poster-7861.jpg&quot;&gt;Be safe, be seen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/06/02/An-Honest-Response</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Below is a conversation with what I can only guess is a young man over a
current classified item I have up &lt;a href=&quot;http://greensboro.craigslist.org/bik/2992518454.html&quot;&gt;for sale&lt;/a&gt; on the Craigslists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His original response to the posting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hello! let’s do like this, actually now I’m not in town for now, I came to visit my son so i wont be able to meet with you but am okay with the price as seen on the advert, I’ll proceed in issuing a Check out to you and when you received the check , I will make arrangement for pick-up. So get back to me with below details asap.
Name:
Address:
City:
State:
Postal Code:
Phone Number:
And as soon as this is provided, the payment will be overnight to you and i will let you know when its mailed out. I need you to be honest with the sale as I am a God fearing person.
Thanks
God Bless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I felt that a response was required:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you were a God fearing person you should know that God eats
Internet scammers and spammers and shits them out into a very special
place in Hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For one, yes “Internet” is still uppercased, I am not sure what the
folks at the AP are on. And second, I am glad that he/she/it believes
that everyone in the South (sometimes pronounced…with emphasis: “THE
SOUTH”) would believe this drivel due to their love. Errrr. Fear of “Gawd”. Also, did
I miss something? Why the fuck is the word “Check” capitalized? Maybe
that’s their name.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Constructive Critisism Goes a Long Way</title>

   <updated>2012-04-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/04/12/constructive-critisism-goes-a-long-way</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yay, I found this blog again…ok well actually, I have been on a writing hiatus and have recently come
only to yell at the Philladelphians. Yes, you guessed it, those “crasser than myself” general (most, not al)
pain-in-the-neck “Soul fans” have gone and sullied up teh interwebz with what can only be considered hippy, limp
wristed drivel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pam, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewebivore.com/why-you-shouldnt-invite-yehuda-katz-to-your-u&quot;&gt;Pam the Webivore&lt;/a&gt; decided that it would be her mission…no, her sole duty to attack a fellow ruby
nerd (Yehuda Katz) by getting “flustered” and damning him on Hacker News today. Please, for the love of all that
is good and smells like wet trash in Philly, refrain from using the word flustered outside of people’s interactions
with &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;albatrosses&lt;/a&gt;. According to Pam, which is frankly a much better name for her blog, Yehuda steamrolled
someone at a local users group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pam made this interaction out to be some kind of barage of sorts, ending with the speaker sitting down because
they couldn’t handle the cricriticism coming from Yehuda. Pam and her Philly-isoms continue to barrate and even
threaten Yehuda for a few more paragraphs. Some might be thinking,  why is Pam and her otherwise lame named blog
such a big deal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People should call you out when your “shit”(Philladelphianism) could use some improvement. Why let people go through
life thinking their stuff is amazing when a few pieces of critisim could help them tremendously? We have become a
nation of rabbid sycophants and where has it gotten us? This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;itis&lt;/a&gt; doesen’t affect all of us though. For example, this
week’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/35&quot;&gt;Founder’s talk&lt;/a&gt; introduced me to Steve Espinosa who feels much the same as I do on this very fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-challenge&quot;&gt;A Challenge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next time a friend shows you a design, app, idea, etc and they are missing something, tell them. Seriously! Don’t
be afraid to ruffle some feathers, complain, call out the haters, live up to your expectaions, deny something,
whatever! Please, please, don’t passively polish shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also although there might be a hearty portion of Philly jabs in this post, I actually quite adore the city, just
not so much Pam.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Be Merry, Track Your Time</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/02/08/Keep-Time-and-Avoid-Being-Anal/"/>
   <updated>2012-02-08T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/02/08/Keep-Time-and-Avoid-Being-Anal</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Although somewhat of an anal sport, time tracking and time tracking software
is often times taken for granted by most folks. Even freelancers, the people
who live and die by their output, all judged on a per hour basis, sometimes
neglect the need of quality time tracking. Hopefully this rant will make even
the deepest salary ridden fool think twice when it comes to skimping on starting
that timer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;software-is-dum&quot;&gt;Software is Dum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is true. I hadn’t thought about it until now, but there is a possibility
that you could time yourself with a stop watch (IN IRL!!) and record each section
onto some &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/63UlBsdElsY&quot;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt;. Just let that sit in. Uh, and I am 99 percent positive
that some people still do it this way. Don’t fret though, there are some quality
alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rescuetime.com/&quot;&gt;Rescue Time&lt;/a&gt;: Sits in the background and tracks time spent on websites,
documents, etc. Focus mode blocks you from distracting websites. Rescue time is
great to guage how distracted you are during the course of a day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slimtimer.com/&quot;&gt;Slim timer&lt;/a&gt;: Currently my staycation. Lean, simple timer that leans heavily
on a robust and easy to understand tagging system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getcashboard.com/&quot;&gt;Cashboard&lt;/a&gt;: Full featured web client that even takes payments. Much more
than just time tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getharvest.com/&quot;&gt;Harvest&lt;/a&gt;: Elephant in the room. Harvest has been around for quite some time
and has a product that is polished and a joy to use. In addition, they have a
dedicated iPhone app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.toggl.com/&quot;&gt;Toggl&lt;/a&gt;: On the same lines as Cashboard. Large project with a responsive design
that works well if you mentally split up everything by client, project, tag, workspace
etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://letsfreckle.com/&quot;&gt;Freckle&lt;/a&gt;: A gorgeous and fun app written with the idea that all software
should be cheerful and a joy to use. Freckle takes the top design award out of
the bunch. In addition, it is written, designed and marketed by the genius power-
duo: Amy and Thomas at &lt;a href=&quot;http://slash7.com/company/&quot;&gt;Slash7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it? Yeah well, this is just a little snippet of what is out there in terms
of web based software. Get your feet wet, find something that fits your lifestyle
and then jump to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-error&quot;&gt;User Error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all of the above software has some form of payment attached to its use, how
does anyone get what they pay for? First ask yourself, are you using it? Aside
from RescueTime, all of the options above have an elegant and simple way to export
tasks into a csv format for billing. Keyword here being “export”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is always (most of the time) the ability to type in a start and end time
for a project. However, this is usually a crap-shoot, which means, if you haven’t
been keeping up, you are undervaluing yourself. All that billable work that is getting completed
but, no one is getting paid. Because someone has timer, “baby” issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true. In almost every case, the software comes bundled with a timer that you
can start once you begin working on a project, and stop when you are finished.
This is a much more acurate rendition of the work. The freelancer is no longer
stiffing himself that hour, and he has a much more accurate view of how long it
takes him or her to complete a givien task. Now we are getting paid more AND we
are 100% better when it comes to estimating? BRILLIANT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be scared to start that timer. For one, it isn’t going to start its self, nor
is it ever going to be exact unless you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;less-boring-shit--more-anal&quot;&gt;Less Boring Shit != More Anal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best headline ever, personally. Anyway, so now that we have a crazy easy and somewhat
scary system put into place to time work, why on earth would we use it outside of
the specific domain? To become a time tracking uber elite, (they are listed next to
the grep uber-elite folks) time tracking must be an integral part of everything you
do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much time did I spend on Hacker News yesterday? Well shit, let me fire up
Slim Timer and run a report for you. General RSS and blog reading, blog formulation,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/glnJ9lK9FJw&quot;&gt;Mr. Pregnant&lt;/a&gt;, ALL of it should be tracked. You are not a fun sponge if you
track how much time you “faffe off” on Fbook and Youtube all day. Everytime the
timer starts and it isn’t timing a piece of creation, a small piece of us know that
we need to get back on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pain will subside, but promise yourself that you will track every activity that
is important or that you want to do less of, or that you want to get paid more
for doing…or whatever. Just start that timer and then proceed to do loads of
awesome shit. We certainly could use more “awesome shit” VS useless Reddit posts
about how to be an American and or a minimalist.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you, the informed Internet user may know, today, the 18th of January, is officially: “Blackout from &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot; title=&quot;Steaming pile of shit&quot;&gt;SOPA&lt;/a&gt; day”. Sites like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/&quot; title=&quot;Reddit&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wikipedia.org/&quot; title=&quot;Wikipedia&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boingboing.net/&quot; title=&quot;Boing Boing&quot;&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/a&gt; will take the day off, and presumably binge (not to be confused with “Bing” the insanely sub-popular search engine who, I guess could give a fuck due to their in-involvement) drink until they passout. Please take a little time out of your day to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm&quot; title=&quot;Robots&quot;&gt;contact a senate robot&lt;/a&gt; and instruct them to hit the “red” button when this bill comes back around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3261/show&quot; title=&quot;Open Congress&quot;&gt;“official” text&lt;/a&gt; or you can enjoy a video by &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/tT_SwAteJ9M&quot;&gt;Alexis Ohanian&lt;/a&gt; if you are currently unable to comprehend words. Please, please, please, do something to protest this egregious piece of legislation! Be informed, make great decisions and do something to help keep free speech on teh interwebz. Also blacklist any and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/276991/20120105/sopa-companies-businesses-groups-support-controversial-bill.htm&quot; title=&quot;Clown-tards&quot;&gt;all of these companies&lt;/a&gt; for the next 60 years.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Summary of Potential Readers</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/01/17/Baby-Faced-Readers/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-17T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/01/17/Baby-Faced-Readers</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote a fascinating &lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/posts/12192011-People_Can_Not_Read/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on the probability of people’s reading skills. With any &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;social inibility&lt;/a&gt; comes a good entrepreneur looking to capitalize. Enter some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theage.com.au/digital-life/smartphone-apps/aussie-wunderkind-gets-us250k-for-technology-that-could-revolutionise-web-20120113-1pz35.html&quot;&gt;some 16 year old and a summary sheet&lt;/a&gt;. His idea? The ability to summarize text using “clever” algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would allowing people to easily ingest reams of information be a bad thing? Well it isn’t until we become too reliant on the technology. And we as a people would, because it’s easy and endorphins are fun…and make us giddy. We, as readers lose the ability to think critically because we don’t need to, we have algorithms for that. From there we find reading comments difficult because we need to parse more than a few things together in order to devise the scope of the entire conversation. Reading…it’s a bitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, that’s the whole point, it’s hard. Writing is as well, just take the time to read a few blog posts around here. In addition, how old is Ben Grubb, who is apparently the “author” of the article? He looks he’s about 2 years short of sprouting his first pubic hair. Man, how I wish I had that level of technology access when I was these kid’s ages. Kudos to them, they will be absolutely ripping when they finally hit puberty.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Flinch For Your Life</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/01/05/The-Merits-of-Flinching/"/>
   <updated>2012-01-05T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2012/01/05/The-Merits-of-Flinching</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;How many times during the day do you think that you flinch? Well, lets change
that around a bit. How man times a day do you put yourself into a situation
where you might flinch? We, as the inhabitants of the
“&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;” love
security. Nice houses, confy jobs where we sit behind a computer and appear to
be doing quality, work. What has all of this confort given us? Better health?
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gohealthinsurance.com/blog-resources/american-health-care-info/&quot;&gt;Nope&lt;/a&gt;,
better retirement? &lt;a href=&quot;http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/12/15/most-employees-not-prepared-for-retirement-infographic/&quot;&gt;Definitely
not&lt;/a&gt;.
What then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing actually. The equation is really quite simple (10-30 somethings) == (a
bunch of video-game players). Even NPR…well ok, the really cool guys at
Freakonomics Radio are making
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/01/04/why-is-%E2%80%9Ci-don%E2%80%99t-know%E2%80%9D-so-hard-to-say-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/&quot;&gt;quips&lt;/a&gt;
at the youth and their love of video games. Without experienceing situations
that scare us, how can we grow mentally and physically? Julien Smith’s new book:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias=aps&amp;amp;field-keywords=flinch&amp;amp;tag=alfredapp-20&quot;&gt;Flinch&lt;/a&gt;
answers this very question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julien is definitely onto something with the idea of shortcircuiting our cronic
avoidance of fear. If, like our gag reflex, we could increase our abilities to
withstand difficult situations, what would this world look like? What do you
think? The book is free on amazon (kindle) and worth the 3 seconds it will take
you to click on the buy now button. Seriously, go read it…if you

   <title>Angry NYC Ruby Devs</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/12/28/Ruby-Developers-In-An-Uproar/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/12/28/Ruby-Developers-In-An-Uproar</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The interesting blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.betabeat.com/&quot;&gt;Betabeat&lt;/a&gt; highlighted a
wonderful
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.betabeat.com/2011/12/27/ruby-developers-offended-by-2800-ruby-class/&quot;&gt;cockup&lt;/a&gt;
by &lt;a href=&quot;http://art.sy/about&quot;&gt;Art.sy&lt;/a&gt;’s main programming squeeze, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dblockdotorg&quot;&gt;Daniel
Doubrovkine&lt;/a&gt;. In short, he began a thread on
the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/messages/archive/&quot;&gt;NYC-rb&lt;/a&gt; mailing list and
like any other &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;Internetz shit storm&lt;/a&gt;, things got
bad fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to look at the whole thread by visiting NYC-rb mailing list
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/messages/archive/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The replys seem to be
under the heading “RoR class for developers @GA in January”. Just search for
the heading and an amass of articles should show themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My thoughts on the whole kurfuffle is as follows. Developers learn by testing
and trying thousands of different platforms. Some of us learn languages better
by grabbing several books off the shelf, others excel much quicker in a
classroom/team setting (I usually fall under the latter). This &lt;a href=&quot;https://generalassemb.ly/ruby-on-rails-for-developers&quot;&gt;specific
class&lt;/a&gt; is 2800$ which
seems like a lot… until you look at some interesting aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.engineyard.com/&quot;&gt;Engine Yard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://pivotallabs.com/&quot;&gt;Pivotal
Labs&lt;/a&gt;, two well known and exceptional Ruby and Rails
shops are backing the project. Does this mean that both will cherry pick a
couple of hungry devs from the class? Perhaps. However, if you are looking for
a reason to get into a classroom with a bunch of brilliant people who might
offer you a job at the end, why balk at the opportunity? In addition, the
classes are 4 hours a week across two days. Which is potentially comparable
with time spent on a 4 credit College course&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software craftsmanship / apprentice pattern seems to be here to stay.
College and higher education is a stagnant game and companies like Engine Yard,
Pivotal, and LivingSocial seem to be looking to help out the community by
alternative means. There will be bumps along the road, but I(my opinion) don’t
feel like this class is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Get Rid Of Command T</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/12/20/Command-T-Sucks/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/12/20/Command-T-Sucks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hardcore text editors always seem to make a concerted effort to actually ease
the opening of different files. Perhaps the most elegant solution was
implemented by &lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; by hitting Command-T. A drawer would open
from the top of the window, the user could begin typing in the name of a file
and eventually hit enter to open it. Other editors have exibited this
functionality and the guys and gals at &lt;a href=&quot;http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen&quot;&gt;PeepCode&lt;/a&gt; even built a handy
app that sits in your menu bar to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were a Vim/MacVim/GVim user you had one of two choices to mimic this
functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the PeepOpen application which is pretty cool and definitely worth the
  money, although it requires a plugin to function with Vim&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a plugin (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502&quot;&gt;Vimball&lt;/a&gt; in this case) named Command-T&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with Command-T came down to the fact that it needed to be compiled
with the system Ruby and so did your version of MacVim. Well, that’s cool, most
people are ok with using OS X’s version of Ruby because it is up-to-date…wait,
nope! For the intelligent person using &lt;a href=&quot;https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/&quot;&gt;RVM&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv&quot;&gt;RBENV&lt;/a&gt;, you needed to make sure to switch off from Ruby 1.9.2 and back
to the system ruby when updating MacVim via &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; or compiling
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this was a serious pain in the ass, trip-plicated by the fact that
MacVim is yet to see a golden, stable release for 10.7. In the most simple of
cases, plugins can be installed by throwing a couple of files and a doc
file(help text) into their respected folders. This action is what makes using
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carlhuda/janus&quot;&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt;(Yes I know it is somewhat frowned upon but I don’t happen to
care, &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/R_5tFHW0prI/AAAAAAAAB-4/YWb6ZKvtFTY/s1600/haters-1.jpg&quot;&gt;sorry&lt;/a&gt;) such an easy package manager. However, if you look how &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/blob/master/Rakefile&quot;&gt;it
handles&lt;/a&gt; Command-t you should be instantly filled with complex waves
of hatred or…at least &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim&quot;&gt;CTRLP&lt;/a&gt;! An elegant and easily installable solution that could
care less about your Ruby implementation. After just a day and a half of random
playing, I am thoroughly impressed and suspect that Command-T won’t make it’s
way back into my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg&quot;&gt;Vim belt&lt;/a&gt;. Although, I have massive respect for
the Vim user who keeps trying to wrestle the beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download CTRLP from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim&quot;&gt;githubs&lt;/a&gt;, add it to your .janus.rake file
with:  &lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2644583.js?file=old style&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; …or use your Vim package manager of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>People Can't Read</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/12/19/People-Can-Not-Read/"/>
   <updated>2011-12-19T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/12/19/People-Can-Not-Read</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you happened to stumble across Cloudbacon this morning, you have witnessed
a slight change to the sidebar. Before, it simply read “CB” (CloudBacon for
the peeps who had yet to figure it out) and a relatively cruddy icon for the RSS
feed. Now, you are greeted with three separate icons. One, a cloud, Two, a piece of
8-bit bacon, and lastly, a punch out of the weird RSS thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of reasons for this change:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I was kinda bored, ok? It happens.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a high likelyhood that people can’t read:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2011/05/04/report-nearly-half-of-detroiters-cant-read/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.life360.com/blog/rich-americans-cant-read-peoples-emotions/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thestir.cafemom.com/food_party/129526/white_coke_cans_pulled_because&quot;&gt;And Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Really these are just a few, it’s ridiculous actually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t read, THUMBS UP, you know where you are, yet you might not be able
to do too much else from here…including reading this. Anyway, if you absolutely
dislike the whole &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography&quot;&gt;iconographic&lt;/a&gt; thing,
feel free to send me some FUD at braden[at]buyurifemme{dot}com.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In finishing this up, there are a lot of articles built into my backlog, so they
might be on their way out but, really no one knows. At most, don’t hold your breath.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Steve Jobs Bio</title>

   <updated>2011-11-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/11/14/On-Steve-Jobs-Biography</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week on &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42&quot;&gt;Hypercritical&lt;/a&gt; (a web show
hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/siracusa&quot;&gt;Jon Siracusa&lt;/a&gt; and aired on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/&quot;&gt;5by5
podcasting network&lt;/a&gt;), Jon talks at length about the
“shodd-i-ness” behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-ebook/dp/B004W2UBYW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1321327391&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Steve’s new
biography&lt;/a&gt;.
The real issue seems to stem from Isaacson’s lack of domain specific knowledge
and unwillingness to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea is something that has been on my mind as of late. Who brings in a
team of individuals to accomplish a task who have zero experience? Would you
turn to a marketer who writes copy all day to solve a UX problem? Unless the
individual has domain specific knowledge of the subject, or they are willing to
learn, they don’t belong in the room, conversation or the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is just sad that Isaacson didn’t do Steve the justice he deserved. The
episode is well worth the hour and 20 minutes of your time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Git Powered Blog Drafts</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/11/10/Git-Powered-Blog-Drafts/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-10T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/11/10/Git-Powered-Blog-Drafts</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, I don’t personally care how you build/host/hump your blog, although in
general, it is probably, wait…for it &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;wrong&lt;/a&gt;. Now that we got that
out of the way, here is a nifty idea to think about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the simplistic yet elegant power behind &lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; to keep a robust and
burgeoning amount of blog posts and drafts. Why? Well Git is able to track
changes across a system fairly well..shit it’s actually the only thing it does.
Being able to track diffrent blog posts, when they were completed and being
able to rewind to them, seems like something a powerful blogger might like to
have at his or her fingertips. To get going you need 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful (some would say the best…and or the “bomb”)
    &lt;s&gt;source&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;version control management system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A static generated site. This means, that all of your files are flat in
  nature and rely on no database to produce the overall content. Not only does
  this solve a nasty &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection&quot;&gt;injection&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt;, but it can
  withstand high amounts of traffic. Here are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathematism.com/2010/12/22/static-site-generators/&quot;&gt;few
  options&lt;/a&gt;(mostly Python and Ruby variants) if you are completely
  lost to this concept. Don’t worry about choosing one that is “wrong”. Most
  of the posts can be moved from one system to another.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the root folder of your newly built static site blog and invoke:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2710866.js?file=git init&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will create a brand spanking new git repo, surrounding your code in a
wonderous pillow of fluffy safety. From here it is really simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2710866.js?file=git branch&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2710866.js?file=git checkout&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you are free to modify your new post to your hearts content. By using
“post” at the beginning of the branch name, it is easy to see what branches are
posts and what are other, structural changes. This concept is ridiculously easy
however, it works well for one reason: nil == friction. One of Git’s most
amazing features is its ability to handle branches and merging said branches
with ease. This “freedom” cuts down on the constant anxiety of “lost work”. If
you aren’t worried about losing work, causing problems, or breaking something
you are free to use 100% of your creative juices to…well create!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elegant solutions will always trample their off-the-shelf, boxed, rural cousins.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thoughts On Reason</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/11/07/Thoughts-On-Reason/"/>
   <updated>2011-11-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/11/07/Thoughts-On-Reason</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Most people with any type of BS or BA degree from a mid sized liberal arts
college, adore banging their own logic drum in some form or another. Often
considered logic’s dipolar brother: emotions are rebelious, temultuous and
overal something that many of us in the technical world strive to avoid.
Although the object in question might resemble a drum, what is actually being
played is something far more &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;phalic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reason, in it’s simplest form, the one read from the dictionary, is the power
of the mind to think, understand and form a judgement. However, reason, in the
words of Raiden is akin to: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJeQ6ZKPxyw&quot;&gt;Finish
him&lt;/a&gt;”! That’s right, it is what
occurs at the very end of a train, not at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one has ever entered a situation and through processing NOTHING, come up
with a sound and logical answer. Our brains, like computers are meant to
internalize, process, bias against and, eventually come up with something that
sounds “correct”. The idea of correctnesss will be taken with a grain of salt
for the remainder of this rant, it deserves its own post later down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea is often tested in some control group, something that won’t harm or
potentially destroy the situation. Afterwards, and really only if a desired
outcome is apparent is the logical answer put forth into action. Logic…appears
to come very last. Except many of us fall into the trap of using it first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well wait? How is that possible? Real thinkers, Einstein, Tesla, Plato, you
name it used their observations and their peers to come to a solution. They
took the surrounding ideas, along with their own and mashed them together much
like today’s meemes. Their logic was a framework built from listening and
observing the masses. They didn’t claim to have every answer at their
fingertips (thank you Jimmy Whales), they relied on empirical studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is seen today is a country full of people who are attempting to fill
everyone’s glass jars with their own version of untested logic. This is
&lt;em&gt;mind-bleeding&lt;/em&gt;! Instead, why not sit back and make conscious attempts to learn
from each human interaction, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it a whirl, you will be surprised how much you learn and how much humility
you exude.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Demanding Free Awesome-Software</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/10/04/Morons-Demand-Free-Software/"/>
   <updated>2011-10-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/10/04/Morons-Demand-Free-Software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If…perhaps you had been sitting under a chair hiding from your
coffin-death-sled this week (Oct 3), the peeps behind the wonderful app
&lt;a href=&quot;http://growl.info/&quot;&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt; released their new itteration on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12&quot;&gt;Mac App
Store&lt;/a&gt;. If you happened
to click on the previous link, you would have realized that Growl has
transitioned itself from something free to something worth $1.99. With most
transitions of this manner, there has been a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU&quot;&gt;metric-shit-ton&lt;/a&gt; of user outcry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growl(an extremely short history) has been the defacto OS X(it does function on
windows), that’s “Macz” for all you &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/migIVbzPW5U&quot;&gt;nubs&lt;/a&gt;,
notification software since August of 2004. Most people forget that the app was
a preference pane tucked away in system preferences. In many cases, Growl came
packaged with other applications that installed it to handle their own
notifications. Thereby relieving the user from ever having to worry about
whether it(Growl) was installed or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now we need to download it from the Mac App Store or MAS if you like
acronyms…and you need to PAY FOR IT! Holy SHIT, like for realz? Pay for it?
For all of you who feel like you are entitled to awesome software, and Growl
falls under this moniker, for free…you’re not. Not-Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These moochers are the same asshats who jailbreak their iPhones to simply
download apps without paying. Although, there are plenty of really great paid
apps on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/migIVbzPW5U&quot;&gt;Cydia&lt;/a&gt; store. They spend hours of
their time searching for free versions of applications that cost them 2.99. The
real problem, before I go over the deep end, is: these developers are not
Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are a small team of good friends who have banded together and spent a lot
of time, sweat, and tears to build something that they hope can turn into a
miniture business. They might have shitty jobs, hard families, or whatever but,
they are there to make an attempt at bettering their overall living situation.
You consistently stealing their apps isn’t assisting them in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, people should be pining to pay for this software, especially
Growl, because it truly is kick ass. It should be your honor and
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_(Japanese\)&quot;&gt;giri&lt;/a&gt; to pay for these great
products. The minimal payment helps feed the developers and allows them to
focus on the software that you have paid for and love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make a budget per week, pay for the software that you love, revel in the fact
that you have helped someone reach their dream and someone might reciprocate on
it when you near yours.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Please refrain from thinking of this post as some kind of jab or ‘attack’ on
America. This is quite simply a collection of attitudes, ideas, and values that
many of my fellow Americans hold too close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t want to try and do something new, it’s scary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Little things about people annoy me, therefore I write them off as immediately “wrong”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn something at home? While I am away from work? FUCK that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write? I barely read an entire book (fiction or technical) in a year, why write?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Think critically? Hmm…that sounds like it goes hand and hand with number 4.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My concentration has been butchered by Youtube so I can’t focus for more then 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I plan on doing nothing to alleviate number 6 or any other numbers…remember number 2?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My work ethic stops at 5pm…on the dot.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am entitled to job X because I have completed X amount of education.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;…but I want to be successfull so shortcuts and eventually my parent’s money will see me through.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t understand other cultures although I may have graduated with a religious studies / women studies / anthropology / european government studies major.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I want to make my “own way”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That work ethic thing, yeah that stuff also ceases on Friday.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I know all I need to know about subject X, especially if I do it as a job.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am too scared to travel because of 1, 2, 3, 7, 11…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I compare myself to my siblings, everything they get, I deserve.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I spend money on things, items, stuff instead of buying tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And above all else: I am bored.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Quicksilver Still Can't Make The Cut</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/23/QuickSilver-For-A-Weekend/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-23T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/23/QuickSilver-For-A-Weekend</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s true, I have never really been much of a fan of the ancient productivity
guru known as “Quicksilver”. It was adopted by all my Mac loving brethren and
even, after several ad-hoc presentations, I continued to obstain. Launchbar was
too small and Spotlight, if mastered couldn’t come close to both the 3rd party
applications. In addition, everytime Quicksilver was left to rot due to an
ambitious developer(s) realizing the size of the project, I was content knowing
there was no need to lament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently the Quicksilver Project was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.qsapp.com&quot;&gt;picked up&lt;/a&gt; by a
group of very talented and driven developers who have a laundry list of grand
plans for the ailing product. With Quicksilver making a rapid comeback, I
decided to drop my current productivity love affair:
&lt;a href=&quot;www.alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; and give the beast a whirl for the span of a long
weekend(4-5 days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Experience&lt;/strong&gt;  Quicksilver still has one of the best looking UXs for its
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_\(software\)&quot;&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;. It jumps into
view with big blocks that are easy to see and clearly show the user what they
are doing at the very moment. Launchbar, with its tiny “unibar” easily fails
hard in this category. Quicksilver’s simple select what you want to do(noun),
tab over to select an action(verb), and if needed, a location approach to doing
things is truly brilliant! If a mistake is made, the user just tabs back to the
problem, fixes it and goes about their merry way. Alfred and Launchbar both
prescribe to a “unibar” philosophy which can be confusing if the user forgets
where they are in their launching process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functionality&lt;/strong&gt;  These applications construct a higher amount of
functionality over Spotlight(OS X default), hence why many of us use them.
Alfred isn’t more than a few years old which means 99% of its functionality
works great on a new, Intel powered, Lion running Mac. Lock, Shutdown, and
other system commands function beautifully (NOT true with Quicksilver) along
with the clipboard, file navigation, etc. Quicksilver continues to be burdened
with the cruft from its days being build on and for the PPC architecture and
man, does it show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app doesn’t run in 64bit mode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many of the plugins haven’t been updated in 4+ years (they are working on
  it)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Several of the apps rely on the PPC architecture which isn’t supported in
  Snow Leopard or Lion (SL was released in August 2009)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The app itself continues to be flaky with several crashes per day under
  heavy use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensibility&lt;/strong&gt;  Quicksilver is known for having an incredibly robust plugin
structure.
1Password, Bbedit, Vim, Photos, FlickrUploads, and etc are just a few that are
at the user’s fingertip. As a self proclaimed “power-user” this excites me.
However, several weeks ago Alfred implemented the ability to run applescripts,
shell scripts, and automator workflows. Although Qucksilver has a leg up with
the raw amount of extensions, many of them need updating because of their age.
I am genuinly excited to see what kind of plugins are developed by Alfred’s
robust and seeminly clever community. Here are just a few so far: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.alfredapp.com/2011/08/02/alfred-extensions/&quot;&gt;Alfred
Extensions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;  At the end of the weekend I simply couldn’t wait to fire back
up Alfred and get back to work. Sure there is always a problem of knowing how
to access similar functions in new applications, however; this wasn’t specific
to my case. I spent a good portion of time tweaking and “groking” the
Quicksilver way (a good 2-5 hours). However, was ultimately unimpressed with
its high crash rate (running on a 1st gen 17inch(2.66C2D/8gigs) Unibody w/ SSD
+ Optibay), inconsistent plugin compatibility, and the amount of time it took
to rescan for new items(fairly sure Quicksilver continues to use its own index,
not Spotlight’s). For the immediate future, this nerd is sticking with Alfred.
In addition, I have a powerpack licences for Alfred so if you &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/wiltj&quot;&gt;don’t feel like
assisting really cool developers&lt;/a&gt;, yet want
some of the functionality mentioned above, stick with Quicksilver as a free
solution.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Seagate Hybrid Drive Solution</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/07/Momentus-XT-Spindown-Solution/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/07/Momentus-XT-Spindown-Solution</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/hybridhd.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;ssd hybrid drive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this past
&lt;a href=&quot;http://cloudbacon.com/posts/08022011-Breath-Life-Into-A-Laptop/&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; I
mentioned using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive&quot;&gt;“hybrid hard
drive”&lt;/a&gt; for secondary storage. In
this case, the hybrid part means that there is a very small, 4 gigs to be
exact, amount of space set aside for caching purposes. If the drive was being
used for boot purposes, it would use those 4 gigs to allocate popular
applications and files that were used frequently. This would speed up the app
launching process and give the allure of having a much faster, SSD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This specific drive has been under fire for some time by the Mac crowd for
disabling, or completely ignoring the internal power management settings. One
of the larger problems being, that the drive blatantly refused to spin down
when not in use. For the forum lover there is quite an extensive amount of
knowledge posted
&lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.seagate.com/t5/Momentus-XT-Momentus-Momentus/Momentus-XT-APM-spindown-feature-causes-quot-lag-spikes-quot-in/td-p/55656&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
However, it doesn’t seem like Seagate has found a fix…yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since upgrading the drive to it’s newest firmware (SD25), my drive was
exhibiting some of these odd behaviors. Everything seemed fine during spin-up;
however, after the system ejected the disk, it would fail to spin-down. At
first, I thought that spotlight indexing was causing problems. Wrong, this was
disabled. The culprit seemed to be a previously deleted file or folder sitting
around in the .trash folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleting BOTH the .spotlightv100** hidden folder along with .trash solved the
issue in a heartbeat. Apparently, there are some
&lt;a href=&quot;http://superuser.com/questions/89556/how-disable-mac-snow-leopard-creating-spotlight-v100-and-trash-folders-in-usb-f#116879&quot;&gt;methods&lt;/a&gt;
to force these folders from being created; however, I have yet to try them. In
addition, this is a fix for the people using these drives as storage, and not
for their main boot partition. If anyone has any other nifty solutions, I would
	love to hear about them&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Mac App Store and Bootable Images</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/03/bootable-images-and-the-app-store/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/03/bootable-images-and-the-app-store</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone worth their Mac loving salt knows how hardware agnostic the OS is. Need
to send your main computer in for repair because of a faulty batch of
harddrives but, want to avoid being out a machine for a couple of important
days?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bootable image is a “snapshot” of everything that is going on at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_\(data_storage\)&quot;&gt;block
level&lt;/a&gt; of your OS. In most
cases, these images are captured using a firewire drive (hopefully soon to be
Thunderbold drive) and can be used to run any other piece of Apple
hardware(computers, not iPads). Well sort of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PPC architecture images can ONLY be booted with PPC Macs and the same goes for
Intel. In addition, a Lion image won’t even boot on an old coreDuo machine
(anyone seen a workaround?). Downtime is reduced to nothing with this
method…or usually. For some reason, several of the apps that were purchased
from the App Store, annoy the user on startup for a username and password.
However when entered, the app simply dissapears. Wonder if anyone else is
seeing odd behavior like this?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Laptop Super Juice</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/02/Breath-Life-Into-A-Laptop/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/08/02/Breath-Life-Into-A-Laptop</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the intelligent world, I run all of my development life on a
Mac laptop. The Unix underneath is exactly what the doctor ordered. However, my
February 2009 17inch Macbook Pro is beginning to show it’s age . This model
roughly translates to a Core2Duo shoved into Apple’s newly updated 17’ unibody
for anyone who doesn’t have Apple’s processor usage
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mactracker.ca/&quot;&gt;memorized&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hemming-and-hawing over the brand new Air’s was extremely difficult because
they are insanely fast, however; are still probably not the best choice for a
single computer setup. In addition, there wasn’t much of a chance that I would
be buying a brand new MBP this year. Especially with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macrumors.com/2011/07/26/apple-finishing-up-work-on-an-ultra-thin-15-notebook/&quot;&gt;heavy
rumors&lt;/a&gt;
that the entire line might be updated in late 2011/2012 (If you are looking for
a computer and need one, don’t wait, nothing is definite).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice fell on upgrading my current machine, so where to start for anyone
in the same place?  Maxing out your ram never hurts (8 gigs in most MBPs) but,
by far the best upgrade for money is jumping on the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive&quot;&gt;SSD&lt;/a&gt; wagon. Most of the
latency that is witnessed in every-day computing is built around how fast you
can access your files and an SSD will drastically lower said latency. A final
and somewhat, hardware-hacker route is to add a secondary hard drive in the
place of the internal SuperDrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there is no new hardware in my near future, the decision was simple:
upgrade all 3. 8 gigs of ram, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820167052&quot;&gt;120gig
SSD&lt;/a&gt;, an
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/&quot;&gt;optibay drive&lt;/a&gt;, and a
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148591&amp;amp;Tpk=momentus%20xt&quot;&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt;
500gig secondary drive.  A word of warning for people pining to move out their
SuperDrive, use the manuals at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifixit.com/Browse/Mac&quot;&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;. With
all unibody MacBook Pros you need to move the bluetooth module from the
internal SuperDrive onto the new optibay. This can be a little tricky due to
the fact that the holes in the optibay are NOT pre-threaded. In addition, the
bluetooth module has small screws, cramped angles, and is just a PIA for anyone
with fingers larger than a 3 year old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a worthwhile upgrade and a computer that handles Lion with
blazing speed. Below are a couple of tweaks that I recommend if going down the
SSD route OR buying an optibay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obtibay&lt;/em&gt;: Two hard drives spinning at the same time will definitely reduce
  your battery life. In addition, people frequently complain that there isn’t
  much cooling going on in the optibay. The fix is to spin the drive up and
  down &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=9596575#post9596575&quot;&gt;when
  needed&lt;/a&gt;. I
  connected the scripts to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; so the drive
  can be easily managed. &lt;a href=&quot;http://qsapp.com/&quot;&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/a&gt; would also work
  here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SSD&lt;/em&gt;: OS X and even Lion fail to be truly built for SSDs(from the ground up).
  Hot File Clustering, which basically tracks frequently used files and moves
  them into the outer-rim is still enabled at the kernel level.  Aww…last
  time I checked SSDs don’t have “outer-rims” like their spinning platter slow
  cousins from the north. Anyway, here are a few
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocztechnologyforum.com/forum/showthread.php?52845-Mac-OSX-Speed-Tweaks&amp;amp;highlight=osx%20tweaks&quot;&gt;tweaks&lt;/a&gt;
  that can be used to improve your SSD experience on OS X.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SSD/Trim&lt;/em&gt;: Trim support is still only supported for Apple branded SSDs. Not
  to worry, there is an easy way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://gdgt.com/question/in-os-x-lion-how-do-you-enable-trim-support-for-ssds-f16/&quot;&gt;get it
  functioning&lt;/a&gt;
  with 3rd party drives.  Please, don’t use Trim Enabler on Lion! The patch is
  based on the 10.6.8 kernel and has yet to be updated (as of 2011.08.02).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SSD&lt;/em&gt;: Install a fresh version of Lion, from a USB key or CD. Imaging an old,
  spinning drive doesn’t make sense if you are migrating to a much quicker
  SSD. Moreover, it is likely that there are a ton of unused files and junk
  “cruft” sitting on your hard drive.  Install fresh, rebuild and be happy
  that everything is clean and as new as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three Finger Swipe In Lion</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/07/22/Lion-Three-Finger-Fix/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-22T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/07/22/Lion-Three-Finger-Fix</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t heard, there was quite a major update to some random &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macosx/&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/a&gt;
this week. With every update, and one done through digital means, there is
bound to be a few “hickups” here-and-there. One of Lion’s most prominent issues
is the 3 finger space switching. This one, somewhat insignificant item seems to
have &lt;a href=&quot;http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck&quot;&gt;brainfucked&lt;/a&gt; many people when it comes to certain applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiping left and right with three fingers used to navigate back and forth in
browsers, flipped through sections in Twitter for Mac, along with bringing up
the application switcher(I believe this was a four finger swipe option). Now,
this gesture seems to jump from one desktop space, to another. Well with a
little help from an application called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bettertouchtool.net/&quot;&gt;BetterTouchTool&lt;/a&gt; there is a possible
solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keyboard shortcuts have been around for years, and many gestures (old and new)
can be fired off by simply touching the correct keys in an awesome order. One
could, if they had the self control to rip themselves away from bitching about
the new Mac OS X, map the cmd + ] and [ keys to mimic the lost features of Snow
Leopard. In addition, BetterTouchTool can take modifier keys, unlike the base
gesture list. This, roughly translated, means that it is possible to gain those
three finger gestures back if you include the option key along for the
ride…Rambling managed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;cmd + ] =&amp;gt; this will mimic a snow leopard three finger swipe right
cmd + [ =&amp;gt; the opposite. I hope you don’t think the hashrocket is included…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Official Anti-Powerpoint Party</title>

   <updated>2011-07-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/07/19/Anti-Powerpoint-Party</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We all know and hate looking at our calendars and seeing a huge block of time
dedicated to a meeting where you KNOW there will be a Powerpoint presentation
involved. The meeting starts and voila! You wake up 50 minutes later swimming
in a pool of your own drool. Not to mention, some angry coworkers commenting on
how you talk in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sweden, in their infinite dislike for automotive speeding have come up with
something truly brilliant: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.anti-powerpoint-party.com/en&quot;&gt;The Anti Powerpoint Party&lt;/a&gt;. We all dislike them,
so why hasn’t anyone come up with this before now? Oh well, here is a very
informative video…&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Syntax Highlighters in Nanoc</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/07/07/Syntax-Hightlighting-in-Nanoc/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/07/07/Syntax-Hightlighting-in-Nanoc</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Code highlighting with say, Wordpress is an absolute breeze. All that is
required is finding the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=code+highlighting&quot;&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; that suits your fancy. This isn’t quite as
easy when using a solution like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nanoc.stoneship.org/&quot;&gt;nanoc&lt;/a&gt; or any other Ruby based static site
generator. This is due to the fact that all of your files are compiled on the
fly into html, instead of being held in a database and being “served” every
time someone visits your site (ala Wordpress/Drupal). For the person who is
smart enough to run a static site, don’t fret. You have several great options
that are dying for implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two that come to mind are &lt;a href=&quot;http://pygments.org/&quot;&gt;Pygments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coderay.rubychan.de/&quot;&gt;CodeRay&lt;/a&gt;. CodeRay is built
with Ruby so it is as easy as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=gem install&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since Pygments is Python specific, we need a little wrapper to make it
work in our Ruby environment. A quick search on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; leads us to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/albino&quot;&gt;Albino&lt;/a&gt;…a wrapper for Pygments. Since it is a wrapper we need to nab
Pygments by invoking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=pygmrents&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=gem albino&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Cloudbacon, I have decided to stick with the Albino gem. The syntax is
easier to write and much more svelte overall. In addition, another Github (I
hang out there a lot) user has a wonderful set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/richleland/pygments-css&quot;&gt;css stylesheets&lt;/a&gt; that
work flawlessly with Albino and Pygments. Simply include the gem in Nanoc’s
Rules file, right before the routes, and add the css file (named ‘default.css’)
into the output directory. Easy - code highlighting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people might ask why I didn’t use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nanoc.stoneship.org/docs/api/3.1/Nanoc3/Filters/ColorizeSyntax.html&quot;&gt;colorize_syntax filter&lt;/a&gt; offered
by Nanoc itself? Well I did get it to work; however, you need to break down the
css output and create your own stylesheet. I love writing &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt; as much as
the next person but, automation is just that much cooler. Get your Nanoc site
under version control and try all three methods, see which one works best, and
get your code out of block quotes. Since the above several lines are bash, and
bash has no color, here is a simple ruby test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2710950.js?file=hello world&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny thing being, I now rely on gist code snippets to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>On Being Opinionated</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/06/18/Opinions-Dont-Suck/"/>
   <updated>2011-06-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/06/18/Opinions-Dont-Suck</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Winning eh (look at the tags at the bottom)? Remember the saying? The one that
everyone who who has ever dubbed themselves “nice” use when they feel
uncomfortable in conversations? Yeah it goes something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Opinionated people suck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;well here is a better one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last was quoted from Democritus. He might have just been some offbeat Greek
philosopher; however, he had a point. We can go through life worrying about the
opinions of others or we can be purposeful and understanding of the fact that
opinions are ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people who choose the latter will be cursed with opinions that upset
people. And people are afraid of this, genuinely and honestly…ruffled.
Seriously, ask people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If by chance you are remotely agitated about what someone has said, you have
one of two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stand up and say something at that very moment. Don’t let it fester and hope
  that you have a chance to raise it in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do nothing. Throw it over your shoulder and forget about it. You lose
  nothing from just letting it go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinions are not evil, being overwrought with emotion about them, is.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>MacBook Air and Five Apps</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/28/macbook-air-fives/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-28T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/28/macbook-air-fives</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://patrickrhone.com/&quot;&gt;Patrick Rhone&lt;/a&gt; has a wonderful podcast and website
known as &lt;a href=&quot;http://minimalmac.com/&quot;&gt;Minimal Mac&lt;/a&gt;. When he interviews guests he
asks, what he likes to call the “MacBook Air question.” The gist of the
question breaks down to: you are given the base &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MC505LL/A?mco=MTk0MjI1MTk&quot;&gt;11-inch MacBook
Air&lt;/a&gt; model and
you need to choose the five most important applications you would install on
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is rather brilliantly minimal and definitely a fun and constricting
way to look at computer ownership. Most of us litter our computers with
applications that we hope, one day, might come of use. Anyway, here is my list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com/&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt; - All of my application launching (all
  five of them) goes through Alfred. In addition, you can fire off
  applescripts, command line arguments, open files in specific apps, move
  files around, control iTunes, and do just about anything…all without ever
  touching the mouse or trackpad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://agilebits.com/products/1Password&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; - Easily the go-to
  password manager(software) for the Mac. Within the last year, I moved all my
  passwords here and haven’t worried once because a web service may have
  leaked my password into the open. Completely indispensable in my mind.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt; - I have been a long time
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vim.org/&quot;&gt;vi/vim&lt;/a&gt; user and there is no way I could find myself on a
  Mac without the ability to jump into the the best &lt;a href=&quot;http://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl&quot;&gt;text
  editor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; created. Yeah I said
  it, deal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; - Dropbox paired with the Mac App Store
  is the only way to set up a new machine. In addition, Dropbox is great for
  keeping dot files, books I am reading, and other projects in sync across a
  myriad of different computers. Sure there might be some security issues of
  late but, who puts their credit card numbers in plain text files…named
  “credit card numbers” in their dropbox?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/&quot;&gt;Omnifocus&lt;/a&gt; - Fuck iCal,
  Things, and every other lame calendar or “todo” application. Omnifocus is
  the grandaddy of
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done&quot;&gt;GTD&lt;/a&gt;
  and will always be a staple on any Mac, iPhone, or iPad now and in the
  future. Let’s be honest, computers need to be more about getting complex
  stuff done over watching Youtube videos and trolling our friends “wicked
  awesome lives” on Facebook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were allowed 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_horse&quot;&gt;dark horses&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/&quot;&gt;Textexpander&lt;/a&gt; - Textexpander allows
  me to have a bank of snippets that get “expanded” into anything when a
  certain key stroke is completed. I have snippets for blogging, dates, email
  signatures, words I consistently misspell, and just about anything else.
  This application is definitely integral in my everyday work flow but, if
  push come to shove, it doesn’t make the top five.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/yorufukurou/&quot;&gt;Yorufukoru&lt;/a&gt; - Yorufukoru is the
  best Twitter application that no one has ever heard of or can say. It might
  not look as slick as the official Twitter client; however, it follows
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957&quot;&gt;Apple’s HIG
  guidelines&lt;/a&gt;
  and embodies the simple yet, insanely powerful mentality.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Malware Inside my Apple</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/19/apple-malware-warrants-idiots-opinion/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/19/apple-malware-warrants-idiots-opinion</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Feel free to take a gander at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/crying-wolf-apple-support-forums-confirm-malware-explosion/3351&quot;&gt;Cnet
article&lt;/a&gt;
before continuing…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it appears that Apple desktops, not iPads and iPhones have become so
ubiquitous that they are now the target of &lt;em&gt;porn&lt;/em&gt; malware. There are a few key
issues with this article that any Apple neophite can throw away (up?) as being
utter rubbish. Ed’s blog is called the “Microsoft Report” and said blog is
hosted on a humungoid network like Cnet. He probably is a little biased and
perhaps doesn’t use an Apple computer, the item he is blogging about, all that
often (hear-say, I don’t know for sure). In addition, you need to approve
&lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; that is installed on a Mac. This would mean that people are
OKing the malware to run, it isn’t “just running on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There just isn’t any way to spin this. There are a lot more people owning Apple
computers today compared with even a few years ago. You are bound to have
a couple more “&lt;a href=&quot;http://yfrog.com/h06wreoxj&quot;&gt;computer literate&lt;/a&gt;” people in the
ecosystem now vs then. Want to stay safe? Take a good look at what you are
authorizing to run, every time your Mac bugs you. It takes 2 seconds, fur-real.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Cheap People = Craptacular</title>

   <updated>2011-05-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/18/cheap-people-suck</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Being a proponent of expensive, yet long lasting items is often tough in a
world where everything is built to be disposable. Rarely ever do you get to be
apart of a conversation that focuses around “build quality” or obsolescence (a
word that many Americans fear more than the end of American Idol). However, it
is always refreshing when someone &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ajkesslerblog.com/being-frugal-makes-you-a-loser/&quot;&gt;pokes the bee’s
nest&lt;/a&gt; and starts
up a rather interesting conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that is problematic in the article, is his usage of the word “frugal.” Frugal is
a word that should be used to describe the “hacker-money-saver” not the person
that buys loads of cheap shit. Aside from this, the post is spot on.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It Skillz Test</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/17/test-your-it-skillz/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-17T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/17/test-your-it-skillz</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The “information technology” field (it’s encapsulated in quotes due to the insane amount of “broadness” that the phrase IT embodies) is a constantly changing, challenging, and often times exhausting swim. A swim in one of those pools that force water against you, so no matter how hard you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.survivaltrainingpool.com/&quot;&gt;swim, you still remain in the same place&lt;/a&gt;. Hmm, that sentence wasn’t any good. Anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/05/it-poll-how-do-you-feel-about.php&quot;&gt;ReadWriteWeb posted&lt;/a&gt; an interesting article today asking its community how they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/05/it-poll-how-do-you-feel-about.php&quot;&gt;felt about their IT skillz&lt;/a&gt;. The funny thing being, RRW never mentioned what skills that we need to feel good about. I guess if you ask, you aren’t doing so hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with IT isn’t the speed that it is moving; frankly it has always been a fairly agile job field. What is occurring is a dynamic shift in the the need of each individual. However, most of us are refusing to pivot. In the past we have needed to be hands on with hardware, maintaining images for our client’s computers, and the big one, making all the decisions. IT pros were the nerds who discovered and ultimately steered the “boat.” Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEOs are demanding that their iPhones work perfectly over the corporate VPN, they crave access to their files wherever they are, and they want all of this at the speed of light. It would appear that the client has yanked control out from underneath the snoozing IT’s arm. Without their power to be the top of the decision chain, the IT professional is helpless, caught in a never ending stream of reaction, and actually quite useless. So what can we do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accept it. Quit looking for meaningless certifications, start a blog, wiki or collaborative project, learn how to sling some code, and focus on implementing open source projects on offsite hardware. The last one is a huge part of my psyche these days. Local hardware is going the way of the dodo (I realize that there are those specific instances where it is an ABSOLUTE need) and there is nothing anyone can do to fight it…except by spending wads of cash. Not interested? Well the Government always needs people but watch yourself, even they are moving fairly quickly these days.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Google Shakes It Up With Chromebooks</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/15/companies-are-scared-of-chromebooks/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/15/companies-are-scared-of-chromebooks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s true, I have been known to put a lot of faith into the humungoid churning
Internet-driver that is “Google.” Gmail is by far the best email app out there,
Google Docs, amazing and even little things like Google powered phone numbers
are wonderful gems. However, I realize that many people don’t feel this way.
They believe that Google is watching over all of their porn emails, selling
advertising to their friends, and listening in on every conversation that you
make to your call girl while using Voice. With all this, I wonder what everyone
is saying about Google’s recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/chromebook/&quot;&gt;Chromebook
announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tim Simonte (can’t seem to find much on him or I would link) wrote a very
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/26756/&quot;&gt;interesting piece&lt;/a&gt; for
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/&quot;&gt;MIT’s Technology Review&lt;/a&gt; focusing on six
reasons why these new notebooks from Google are a “bad idea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tom thinks that because the Chromebook doesn’t support iPod integration (I
  believe Tom means overall Apple integration, ala iTunes) many people will
  waiver on the purchase. Did Google say that there wouldn’t be iPod
  integration? Nope. Sure, you can put a lot of money on the fact; however, it
  simply isn’t one…yet. If it were true and if
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macstories.net/news/the-ipod-is-still-strong-grips-76-percent-of-market/&quot;&gt;Macstories&lt;/a&gt;
  were to correctly slug their posts, or just add a year to the date, the iPod
  commands 76 percent of the market. Wait, lets scrap the numbers game, there
  has been a sizeable crowd spreading rumors about cloud syncing in the next
  iOS. Why couldn’t we connect to our Apple music locker through webdav and
  place mp3’s in it, then sync them back to our iDevice family?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At 349-430$ these guys are simply too expensive. Tom’s right, those are some
  expensive numbers; however, Google also said that they would lease them at
  20$ for students and 28$ for businesses on a per monthly basis. Wow, 20
  measily bones a month for a laptop when I was in college would have been
  awesome. Plus, after a certain amount of time, Google could send the user a
  brand new laptop and the user would send their old one back to Google. This
  is unconfirmed however, most PC leasing programs reflect this already. 20$ a
  month plus access to new and better hardware when it becomes available?
  Sounds pretty sweet to these ears.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ok he has a point here: people aren’t ready for the cloud. Mainly because
  they are pansies, scared that their illegitimate children’s ssn might make
  it back to their current family, or got burned by the recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216098/Amazon_outage_sparks_frustration_doubts_about_cloud&quot;&gt;Amazon
  outage&lt;/a&gt;.
  The fact is, a cloud OS doesn’t mirror the same functionality we are used to
  in our current computer OSs. It lives somewhere else, on someone else’s
  servers, under someone else’s control. You don’t have to worry about
  updates, bugs (Tom thinks different), migrating data to new computers,
  etc…really the list is too long and warrants it’s own post. Just think of
  all the cool stuff you could accomplish if viruses, malware, and updates
  weren’t top of mind?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tom thinks the security in ChromeOS is “better, but much worse.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication&quot;&gt;Two factor
  authentication&lt;/a&gt; is
  where you have a username and password along with a separate numerical
  number that is constantly changing. Once the user imputs a correct username
  and password, they need to imput the random number that is currently marked
  as “valid.” These numbers are usually handed to the user through an app on
  your phone or in the form of a small
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_fob&quot;&gt;fob&lt;/a&gt;. There are only two applications
  that I use that have this kind of authentication built in: World of Worcraft
  and my &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your.html&quot;&gt;Google
  account&lt;/a&gt;.
  Right Tom…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Google can’t do hardware and support.” Yep, this is Tom’s only striking
  point. Does anyone remember the 3g issues that were apparent with the Nexus
  1? Yeah, the big G had a hell of a time getting their &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2010/01/09/google-nexus-one-support-forums/&quot;&gt;support figured
  out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Google gets too much control.” This was taken care of several paragraphs
  before with the words: pansie and porn. Actually, I should just rename this
  whole post to: “Pansies and Porn.”&lt;/li&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;…today brought forth a story of well,
borific preportions. The wonderful and apparently always sane PR team at
Facebook thought that it would be smart to pitch anti-Google stories to online
newspapers and blogs. The problem was, one of those bloggers didn’t feel like
going along with the whole idea. A few emails later and everyone knows a major
player in the tech industry is hating on Google. Eventually, dealing with
mounting evidence, Facebook issued a statement claiming it was their cockup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blogs began picking up the story and before anyone knew it, it was everywhere.
The issue is…who cares? So Facebook happens to hire a PR firm to slander
Google, maybe a little competition is a good thing. Then again, I played rugby
for several years and playing dirty is the only way that game is fun. Facebook
was in the wrong, they got caught, snoring really. Bring on the cooler shit!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a friend, and bless his heart, he loves to hold over my head, my once
intolerant mood towards OS X. It’s true, Tiger (again in my mind) was horrible,
PPC’s were incredibly expensive, and most Mac portables during the early 2000’s
were unreliable and not worth my money. So what did the &lt;del&gt;fashion&lt;/del&gt; OS
conscious hipster use back then? For me, it was Linux, and mainly because I had
been using it since around 2000 or when I hit 16.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Use hosted services in lieu of hosting on your own hardware (or virtual hardware) for all but the most custom applications.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ruby Job of The Week</title>

   <updated>2011-05-04T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/05/04/engine-yard-job</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ruby, Rails, and “micro-builders” like Sinatra are seeing a boon these days in
the engineering world. Just a few days ago (er last night I guess) we had a
going away party for a prominent Rails dev in town who is on their way to
&lt;a href=&quot;www.livingsocial.com&quot;&gt;Living Social&lt;/a&gt;. As I was perusing through
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taskrabbit.com/&quot;&gt;taskrabbit&lt;/a&gt; today I happened to see a rather cute
sticky note that said they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taskrabbit.com/main/careers&quot;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;
for a senior Rails engineer with 5k as a signing bonus! And to top off all this
	hiring madness, One of my favorite rails based companies: &lt;a href=&quot;www.engineyard.com&quot;&gt;Engine
	Yard&lt;/a&gt; is on the
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/jobvite.aspx?b=nTGPvgwE&quot;&gt;lookout&lt;/a&gt; for an App
	Support Engineer with a heaping amount of Rails power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of all this money being thrown around the Rails community? Well, for
anyone just getting into RoR and the Ruby world, there is plenty to look
forward to. At the moment, I wish there was a way to supercharge my Rails
ability so I could fit in at one of these places. Engine Yard would be
incredible, the guys there are just plain insanely smart, Taskrabbit seems like
a great place to work in SF (although they do seem to have a lot of Biz dev
guys and gals over there), and LivingSocial is on a rocket ride with their
recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/the-tech-observer/2010/12/02/amazon-eyes-investment-in-living-social-as-counter-to-google-groupon-play&quot;&gt;capital from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out there, learn some Rails and get yourself hired.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Something New and An App</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/04/26/an-update-and-app/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/04/26/an-update-and-app</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ok, so to be fair there hasn’t been all that much going on around here lately.
There was some obscure update about moving things away from a database type
system on to flat files yet, no further updates. Yep well, don’t get your
hearts in a tizzy because this is &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; from a formal post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some plans moving forward though are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update the css to something far moah sexier these days, lets say
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;sass&lt;/a&gt;. I write in SCSS (because it’s new bitches!),
  none of that old .sass stuff…well sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fix this home page bullshit. Maybe I will kick the blog into it’s own world
  and have some type of awesome, fairly un-ballsy welcome page for you all to
  sift through.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&quot;http://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; fired up and working. If you work your way
  back through some past articles, Disqus pops up and seems to function here
  and there…I just need to lock it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, that’s it really. Oh the app, right! The boys (and presumably girls) from
&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.tweetdeck.com/new-ios&quot;&gt;Tweetdeck&lt;/a&gt; have released a welcome update
to their iPhone app. They claim it to be a complete re-write which, take it as
you will, may or may-not be true. I spent a few minutes playing with it this
afternoon and am quite impressed. The original app wasn’t a deal breaker for
the iPhone like it was the iPad, and apparently they are on track with updating
the iPad version very soon. I wonder if they got the memo from Apple a couple
of years ago describing the universal app availability?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Triumphant Return to Cloudbacon</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/04/18/wordpress_to_ruby/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/04/18/wordpress_to_ruby</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And we are BACK!. That’s right, I haven’t really been gone, vacationing, or
really anything else more glamorous than sitting around on my duff. However,
what is really changed…again…is the blog. In less, than 2 months Cloudbacon
has migrated from &lt;a href=&quot;www.posterous.com&quot;&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt;, to
&lt;a href=&quot;www.wordpress.org&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt;, and now resides in flat text files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are absolutely wrong, wait what did you guess that we are using as a CMS
now? I would put some serious money down to deny that you guessed
&lt;a href=&quot;http://nanoc.stoneship.org&quot;&gt;Nanoc&lt;/a&gt;. Nanoc is actually a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.guestlistapp.com/post/2304152860/five-reasons-to-use-a-static-site-generator-instead-of&quot;&gt;static site
generator&lt;/a&gt;
that has some nifty features baked in to provide anyone with a simple blogging
process. Why on earth would Cloudbacon make such a drastic change (from PHP to
Ruby) in the course of a Month? You asked…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No security issues: Less to be exact. MYSQL, which is &lt;strong&gt;STILL&lt;/strong&gt; the only way
  to enjoy Wordpress can be somewhat unstable and prone to &lt;a href=&quot;http://unixwiz.net/techtips/sql-injection.html&quot;&gt;injection
  attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Text files: Anyone who has ever met me knows how much I adore the simplicity
  apparent in text files. They are versatile, captivating, and incredibly
  small. Actually, who here doesn’t know about text files? I am not talking
  about “Word documents.” I am belaboring about those weird, little files that
  have a “txt” at the end of them. Please…take the time to do some research
  on why they kick ass.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Git: Now that MYSQL has been removed from the backbone of Cloudbacon, this
  editor is now able to use Github and Git as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control&quot;&gt;revision control
  system&lt;/a&gt;…HUZZAH! Do a little
  research here as well if you are lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is definitely quite a few rough edges laying around but I wanted to get a
MVB (Minimum Viable Blog) rolling and leave iteration for later. As always, the
scope of things around here won’t change too much. If you are into Apple,
beautiful code, the sexy Web, or just into community; this place should be
pretty fucking cool to hang out. For now, here is a good start to rid yourself
of that Wordpress site (I really love the guys behind Wordpress, they kick a
lot of ass).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Color Me Castrated</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/04/05/color-me-castrated/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-05T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/04/05/color-me-castrated</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/Color-iPhone-App.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Color Application Actually in Use&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably have never heard of it but,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.color.com/&quot;&gt;Color&lt;/a&gt; is a new photo sharing app for the
iPhone. Although it might be fairly unknown, this app has already garnished a
healthy 41 million dollars in venture capital from the fabled Valley firm:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2011/tc20110324_504360.htm&quot;&gt;Sequoia Captial&lt;/a&gt;. To put that number into perspective, that is &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;
than Sequoia gave Google in the early days. Let’s start with what the haters
are saying and move into something more positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uncle Leo Laporte on his fabled &lt;a href=&quot;http://twit.tv/twit&quot;&gt;TwiT&lt;/a&gt; radio
show called Color a waste of money and an immediate failure.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://scobleizer.com/&quot;&gt;Robert Scoble&lt;/a&gt; picked up a few pieces but, in
general was echoed out by a wonderfully large group of people on Leo’s side.
This sentiment seems to be transcending throughout the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=color+41+million&amp;amp;tbm=blg&quot;&gt;blogosphere&lt;/a&gt;,
with very few positive voices squeaking through. Much of this mashing of teeth
derives from these people seeing no real value in the product, certainly not
the pro-ported 100+ million dollar evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core, Color is just another photo sharing application that is currently
stuck on the iOS platform. Its functionality might be reminiscent of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://picplz.com/&quot;&gt;Picplz&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; but, this is where the
generalizations stop. The kick-ass function baked into Color is its ability to
create ad-hoc social photo networks (streams) on the fly. The application uses
the phone’s built-in GPS along with an audio key to pair users together. There
is no friending people, no you follow someone; however, just being near each
other create the essence of “following.” Pretty fucking cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have fiddled with the app for a bit and since I live with some iPhone touting
nerds, it is easy to see the value in the technology. It is incredibly fun to
see photos taken by friends pop into the local feed. People perceive this
mostly hilarious world in such different ways and I believe this app grasps
this better than anything currently available. You are able to see what people
are focused on, what they care about, and what they think (comments are baked
in) all in real-time. It gives the user the ability to experience every
situation in a party where before he/she was trapped to what was directly in
front of him/her. Not to worry though, there are some definite rough spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you live around people who have access to an iPhone you are pretty much
out of luck unless you happen to be checking the application while at the park
and pair up with random folk. It is doubtful that this pitfall will ever go
away since this is really what the entirety of the application hinges on.
Moreover and before a much-needed update, the interface was extremely bizarre.
Icons didn’t really make much sense and you had to stumble your way through the
experience until you grasped what was really going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure there are a few shortcomings but, the technology is new, it’s being used
in a chat application called &lt;a href=&quot;http://yobongo.com/&quot;&gt;Yobongo&lt;/a&gt; and
really nothing else that I am aware of at this very moment. With the
high potential for failure(not exactly true when you have 41 million burning a
whole in your pocket) I believe that the Color team has made something truly
interesting in a sea of “meh” experiences. And let’s be honest, why the fuck
are all these “tech elites and taste makers” hating on a modicum of innovation
in the Valley? Get out from behind your ancient blogs and podcasts and make
something disruptive!&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2011-03-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/26/ssh-like-a-linux-pro-you-dawg</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Neck beards rejoice! No longer must you feel trapped to use $cat commands to
awkwardly get your &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell&quot;&gt;SSH&lt;/a&gt; key from
your Mac to your Linux server…with its’ ridiculous up-time. Since this
network admin rarely believes in using Windohs in a server environment, the
below trick might not work for Windows knuckle draggers. For everyone else,
give it a whirl, fire up terminal and connect to your favorite server and copy
your SSH / rsa keys the old-fashioned way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711060.js?file=ssh 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711060.js?file=copy-id&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should get some crazy error explaining that your Unix powered Mac is
missing this command. Huh? Because most “normal people” (sadly Macs are getting
more and more simplified due to the influx of iOS people hopping on board)
refuse to try to understand what a server is, let a lone SSH, Apple doesn’t
need this rather integral command? Everyone else, you are in luck. Fire up my
favorite Mac OS X packet manager: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; and type the following command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711060.js?file=brew ssh&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give it a few minutes while the magic finishes, log back into your server
and give the command a whirl again. However, the above snippet only works if
SSH is listening on the default port (port 22). If you were smart and changed
the defaults, this command should throw less fail flags:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marketing is balls easy if you think about it. You are trying to entice people to spend their money, which down deep inside they really are already ok parting with. Again, marketing isn’t hard for most of us but, one might need to be able to write or at least be able to piece coherent thoughts together into prose. Que me sucking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend some type of short typing challenge if you happen to be plagued by this very issue. Anything should do, 350 word pure regurgitation, poems, haikus yes, I know this is a poem, just a hell of a lot cooler or anything fuck, just write something. Being relatively drunk and tired, this is all I’s got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;symphony of the mind&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;coalesce&amp;nbsp;forever young&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>2011 MacBooks Can't Take It</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/21/2011-macbooks-cant-take-it/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-21T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/21/2011-macbooks-cant-take-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/overheating-laptop.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Fry an egg on a mac&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know it is a Sunday night and there are much “cooler” things going on
like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marco.org/3991237704&quot;&gt;@Marco’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23dickbar&quot;&gt;#dickbar&lt;/a&gt; post. Or
perhaps the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gigaom.com/2011/03/20/in-att-t-mobile-merger-everybody-loses/&quot;&gt;shit going down between AT$T and T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;? So why focus on something as trivial
as a bunch of overheating Macs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buying a MacBook Pro, at least for the past 5 years, and a PowerBook before
that meant that you were paying a little extra money to get your grubby mits on
a machine of potentially insane power. With this quad-core
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/&quot;&gt;Macbook Pro&lt;/a&gt; refresh, consumers have
access to amazing portable computers. However, said computers aren’t devoid of
a few serious bugs. First to appear was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=13143936&quot;&gt;ominous flicker&lt;/a&gt;
when one of Apple’s very own Apple Cinema Displays was plugged into the new
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/&quot;&gt;thunderbolt / mini display port&lt;/a&gt;.
Now, people are seeing their powerhouses &lt;a href=&quot;http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2768351&quot;&gt;hard freeze under load&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bleeding-edge technology like Thunderbolt (how the fuck do you write that
btw? is it Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt port, the thunderbolt?) is bound to exhibit
some kinks but, a computer that is given an insane amount of raw processing
power (I am serious jealous and I have a first gen unibody 17 which is no
slouch) faltering when you throw something complex at it? Something definitely
is wrong. If anyone has purchased one of these little beasties and you are
experiencing some of the issues mentioned
&lt;a href=&quot;http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=2768351&quot;&gt;in this thread&lt;/a&gt; you are in luck. What you may or may not realize is, you purchased
the right computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take it back. Apple, knows these issues are occurring and will swap out your
computer or attempt to get it fixed within a few days. Some people are even
reporting a 24 hour turn around. My computer has developed an odd flicker and
because I purchased AppleCare, 2 years later I am still receiving amazing
customer service from the boys and girls at 1 Infinite Loop. These issues can
definitely be classified as “no fun” and the hard freeze issue is a
productivity sponge; however, arm yourself with a video of the issue and go see
an Apple Genius. Moreover, have fun, you spent 2k on a machine that will last a
good long time and dominate most applications during it.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fixing MYSQL in Homebrew</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/20/fixing-mysql-in-homebrew/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-20T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/20/fixing-mysql-in-homebrew</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDIT&lt;/em&gt;: Sometimes this doesn’t happen. It seems to be a random occurrence on a random smattering of systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are even thinking about a career or just having some fun with software development, I recommend a handy little company named Apple and a package manager called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;. Mac OS X (pronounced O-S 10) is basically a prettier shell of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix&quot;&gt;Unix&lt;/a&gt;, minus all the kick ass packet managers (APT, MiKTex, YUM, etc). These “package managers” allow the user to install and uninstall applications via the terminal without having to do all that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecoffee.com/tipsforlinux/articles/27.html&quot;&gt;make, make install bullshit&lt;/a&gt;. I have been using Homebrew without a problem up until yesterday when I attempted to install MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t need to worry about these things because there is an application called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html&quot;&gt;MAMP&lt;/a&gt; that takes all the legwork out of dealing with Apache, MySQL, and PHP on your Mac. If you want something fairly robust and plan only on doing HTML, CSS, and PHP then this little application should be fine for your needs. If you decide you want to branch out into Ruby, Rails, Django, etc you might find the need to install these items via source. However, this brings me to another point. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dev.mysql.com/&quot;&gt;The MySQL dev page&lt;/a&gt; has a simple .dmg that you can use to download and install MySQL on your Mac.  So wait…why on earth would I pull my hair out for six plus hours trying to get MySQL to function properly with Homebrew?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homebrew creates a simple repository for all your package needs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link&quot;&gt;symlinks&lt;/a&gt; the files into their required locations. This makes updating packages ridiculously easy as well as installing said packages. No needing to guess if you removed all those pesky files sitting around your system. Simply type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=brew install&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you are golden. Golden until you try to grab the MySQL formula. Without further ado, let’s fire up &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/iterm2/&quot;&gt;ITerm2&lt;/a&gt; or Terminal and get this functioning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First make damn sure that /usr/local is rocking the correct permissions required by Homebrew. After a major OS X upgrade (from 10.6.5 to 10.6.6) this folder can revert back to its’ default permissions. To solve this we:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=chown&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: The correct snippet uses primes (`) (the mark beside the number one on a US Keyboard), not single quotes. For some reason these don’t parse well with Wordpress. This just gives you ownership under /usr/local so you don’t have to install every formula with the sudo command. Some people have “security” issues with doing this but, they are just really just crybabies. Next tell Homebrew that you really want the MySQL formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=brew mysql&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should take some time, don’t worry. When it finishes it will regurgitate some commands to finish the installation. Here is what we need to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=build mysql&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have issues with this without prepending “sudo.” If the chown -R command worked successfully, it should build all the default tables and the root user. Normally the root user is created without a password but, through this installation, the MySQL instance is actually created without any dummy tables or users (even root!). Before we go any further let’s make sure that the server is off:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=launch_ctl&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, lets force the server (mysqld) to startup regardless of permissions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=grant-tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the server is running open a separate window or tab (in Terminal/iTerm) and login to the server with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=u root&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything worked out, you should be presented with a mysql&amp;gt; prompt and full access to the database. Next up on the chopping block, we need to create some users. When issuing the next couple of commands the server should tell you that 0 tables were changed. Don’t fret, we aren’t changing tables, just permissions; MySQL is obligated to tell you every little thing it does…it is boring like that. In addition, all of the below is case-sensitive (For peeps who don’t work with strait MySQL queries)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=gistfile1.sql&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change the “YOUR_PASSWORD” field to whatever you like and DONE! Yep, that is it. Now you can start and stop the MySQL server at will with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/2711119.js?file=server stop start&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After figuring out all of this around 3am this Sunday morning, I realized that my life is nothing but a bag of awesome-problem solving door knobs. Go forth and install MySQL not through MAMP or the dev .dmg but, through a fully featured, and sometimes broken (there will always be trade offs) package manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;del&gt;worst&lt;/del&gt; best. Well nursing a food comma from lunch this afternoon,
I stumbled onto &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2011/03/18/professionalism-is-for-amateurs/&quot;&gt;this post about “professionalism”&lt;/a&gt; from the editor / owner
of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thenextweb.com/&quot;&gt;The Next Web&lt;/a&gt;. The
epidemic issue underlying the idea of professionalism is the fact that people
hide behind it. They might initially think it is the correct way to act in a
business situation; however, as they evolve it becomes a shield and eventually
a crutch. I implore everyone to read the article, it is quick, easy and written
oh so much better than what I could produce. Afterward, think long and hard why
you may weight the idea of “professionalism” so highly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Is Twitter Scared Again? Oh Right</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/15/why-is-twitter-scared-again-oh-right/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/15/why-is-twitter-scared-again-oh-right</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Late last week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rsarver&quot;&gt;Ryan Sarver&lt;/a&gt; (head of
API and platform at Twitter) came out and announced that they would like it a
lot if developers would &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a?pli=1&quot;&gt;focus more on stats and less on clients&lt;/a&gt;. Many people don’t know this but,
Twitter was basically jump - started into popularity by the myriad of clients
that could access the API. In the early days, Twitter.com (
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mettadore.com/ruby/ruby-cant-scale/&quot;&gt;Ruby sometimes has scaling issues&lt;/a&gt;) was so unbelievably buggy that many of us early adopters relied
heavily on these 3rd party clients just to access our tweets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the folks at Twitter are asking these devs to stop? Something doesn’t sound
right…and here’s why! Protect and defend instead of innovate and kick ass.
Some strategy yah got there &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/dickc&quot;&gt;Dick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/client_ss.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Twitter Client Usage Pie Chart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the 3rd party clients you guys and gals are using or perhaps jazzed
about at the moment? Anything cool coming down the pipeline that might be
railroaded by this decision?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Duck Stepping Around Privacy in My Underwear</title>
   <link href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/15/duck-stepping-around-privacy-in-my-underwear/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-15T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://lanyon.getpoole.com/2011/03/15/duck-stepping-around-privacy-in-my-underwear</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/facebook-facebook-funny-unemployment-demotivational-poster-12507291711.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Facebook Scratched Out&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this single case, please feel free to think of me walking around this issue
while only wearing a hot pink thong…and there goes my two readers. Any-who,
	the idea of privacy is a HUGE issue plaguing and potentially clogging up our
	inter-webs. Mr. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/most_influential_person_is_moot/&quot;&gt;Moot&lt;/a&gt;
	Poole has recently flung a &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2011/03/13/4chan-moot-christopher-poole-sxsw/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Venturebeat+%28VentureBeat%29&quot;&gt;curve
	ball&lt;/a&gt; at Facebook’s founder and chief: Mark Zuckerberg over this very
	issue. Before we get there, let’s juice some of the clueless readers up to
	speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg, almost all of Google (whether they like it or not), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/jeffjarvis&quot;&gt;Jeff Jarvis&lt;/a&gt; have been beating a drum
filled with anything but anonymity. They believe that the web needs to be
inhabited with people identified as themselves, not some obscure name that
means nothing to the rest of us. By identifying everyone with their first and
last names, people are more apt to act like humans instead of ass-hats when it
comes to interacting with each other. This is a stark contrast from what
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4chan.org/&quot;&gt;4chan&lt;/a&gt; founder Chris Poole holds to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris believes that this very anonymity leads to sparks of creativity,
awesomeness, or anything potentially better than what could come about from
openness. Poole was quoted this week in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2011/03/13/4chan-moot-christopher-poole-sxsw/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Venturebeat+%28VentureBeat%29&quot;&gt;SocialBeat&lt;/a&gt; article saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The cost of failure is really high when you are contributing as yourself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist of this being that Chris finds the Zuckerberg way to be a little suspect and perhaps stifling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s ask someone who really matters in this little scuffle. This “person” is
someone who everyone knows quite well but, might not be aware of. That someone
is your &lt;a href=&quot;http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/01/quieting-the-lizard-brain.html&quot;&gt;lizard brain&lt;/a&gt;. Your “lizard brain” (for the lazy people who read this) is the part
of your brain that makes your life simple, easy and extremely boring. It is the
part of the brain that slows us down, it makes us think twice in every matter,
and allows us to do “just enough.” In short, being anonymous is feeding that
lizard brain, and being open isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If our identities are shrouded in secrecy, we are more willing to post random,
obscene, and sometimes offensive shit. And why not? All of us have
an innate hankering to do so. We are just always a tinge scared that we will be
found by our employers, our family or whomever. This fear causes us to hold
back, think twice, and ultimately decide against the action overall. Plug in
that lizard powered anonymity and BOOM! It is easy to share that picture
because it is likely to never be linked back to its’ originator. The hard part
and ultimately the part that goes directly against your lizard brain, is
sharing that article with your name plastered all over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This idea can be easily linked to the real world. Our brains never produce
retorts during an actual situation. We always have amazing epiphanies after our
coworker tells us off or that idiot &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kife&quot;&gt;kifes&lt;/a&gt; our amazing parking spot.
Moreover, you don’t want to create a scene because you are not entirely sure if
the person could kick your ass or not. Pure Lizard Brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I a proponent of a completely open web? Well, yes quite frankly. However, I
have walked around the Baltimore Inner Harbor in just my underwear (I lost a
bet). So I might not be the best person in the world to consult with when it
comes to the power of being clandestine; however, I do understand there is a
need for it (at times). I will admit that I deeply enjoyed the idiot magnet
that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/&quot;&gt;Techcrunch’s&lt;/a&gt; comments before they
went to Facebook and ultimately to a completely open system. Then again, I love
seeing people make complete asses of themselves on the net. Call me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this Article or the SocialBeat’ lead us down a better understanding
concerning this privacy standoff? Doubtful. If ever a phrase embodied this
conundrum it is: &lt;a href=&quot;http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/haters-gonna-hate&quot;&gt;Hater’s gonna hate&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity is fairly hard to come by when you are surrounded by brown,
faux-wood walls and everyone simply slaves away in their respected rooms.
Company culture is a key factor when it comes to retaining some of the best and
brightest employees, so why do many companies throw this incredible need on
their “backburner?” Well, maybe something like this chalk board table tennis
table will give your culture the shot of speed it so desires. Warning, 4k isn’t
cheap for anything; however, can you really put a price on creativity? I mean,
come’on!&lt;/p&gt;

to do with a high probability that there is some “aydeeachdee” in them there

will no longer be using it for my main blog. That means Cloudbacon is on the
move to something special, just give me a second…it really is close.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/Social-Media-300x249.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Social Media Cluster Fuck&quot; class=&quot;centered&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media managers are by far the lamest, most influential, sweatiest, noobs
in the work force. Don’t get me wrong, I was one and this very post is an
interesting bit of reminiscing on my part. Sure, the setting wasn’t the best,
and often times people would point out how copious some folks derriere’s were
compared to the rest of the male population but, who really cares when your job
is actually kinda fun? However, there exist many a folk who think the job of a
Social Media “b-yatch” is a walk in a breezy park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wonderful…maybe, people at &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.socialcast.com/&quot;&gt;Socialcast&lt;/a&gt; created an &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.socialcast.com/e2sday-the-hectic-schedule-of-a-social-media-manager/&quot;&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt;
(grr, everyone knows infographics &lt;a href=&quot;http://b.lesseverything.com/2011/2/1/infographs-are-ruining-the-internet&quot;&gt;BLOW&lt;/a&gt;)
that outlines the day of a Social Media Maven, or MMVENS for shorts. Do you
have some serious chops when it comes to culling what could be prescribed as
ADHD? Well, a job of this caliber might be right up your alley.&lt;/p&gt;
