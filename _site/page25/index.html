        It Skillz Test

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 May 2011</span>

    <p>The “information technology” field (it’s encapsulated in quotes due to the insane amount of “broadness” that the phrase IT embodies) is a constantly changing, challenging, and often times exhausting swim. A swim in one of those pools that force water against you, so no matter how hard you <a href="http://www.survivaltrainingpool.com/">swim, you still remain in the same place</a>. Hmm, that sentence wasn’t any good. Anyway, <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/05/it-poll-how-do-you-feel-about.php">ReadWriteWeb posted</a> an interesting article today asking its community how they <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/05/it-poll-how-do-you-feel-about.php">felt about their IT skillz</a>. The funny thing being, RRW never mentioned what skills that we need to feel good about. I guess if you ask, you aren’t doing so hot.</p>

<p>The issue with IT isn’t the speed that it is moving; frankly it has always been a fairly agile job field. What is occurring is a dynamic shift in the the need of each individual. However, most of us are refusing to pivot. In the past we have needed to be hands on with hardware, maintaining images for our client’s computers, and the big one, making all the decisions. IT pros were the nerds who discovered and ultimately steered the “boat.” Not anymore.</p>

<p>CEOs are demanding that their iPhones work perfectly over the corporate VPN, they crave access to their files wherever they are, and they want all of this at the speed of light. It would appear that the client has yanked control out from underneath the snoozing IT’s arm. Without their power to be the top of the decision chain, the IT professional is helpless, caught in a never ending stream of reaction, and actually quite useless. So what can we do?</p>

<p>Accept it. Quit looking for meaningless certifications, start a blog, wiki or collaborative project, learn how to sling some code, and focus on implementing open source projects on offsite hardware. The last one is a huge part of my psyche these days. Local hardware is going the way of the dodo (I realize that there are those specific instances where it is an ABSOLUTE need) and there is nothing anyone can do to fight it…except by spending wads of cash. Not interested? Well the Government always needs people but watch yourself, even they are moving fairly quickly these days.</p>

        Google Shakes It Up With Chromebooks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 May 2011</span>

    <p>It’s true, I have been known to put a lot of faith into the humungoid churning
Internet-driver that is “Google.” Gmail is by far the best email app out there,
Google Docs, amazing and even little things like Google powered phone numbers
are wonderful gems. However, I realize that many people don’t feel this way.
They believe that Google is watching over all of their porn emails, selling
advertising to their friends, and listening in on every conversation that you
make to your call girl while using Voice. With all this, I wonder what everyone
is saying about Google’s recent <a href="http://www.google.com/chromebook/">Chromebook
announcement</a>.</p>

<p>Tim Simonte (can’t seem to find much on him or I would link) wrote a very
<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/editors/26756/">interesting piece</a> for
<a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/">MIT’s Technology Review</a> focusing on six
reasons why these new notebooks from Google are a “bad idea.”</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tom thinks that because the Chromebook doesn’t support iPod integration (I
  believe Tom means overall Apple integration, ala iTunes) many people will
  waiver on the purchase. Did Google say that there wouldn’t be iPod
  integration? Nope. Sure, you can put a lot of money on the fact; however, it
  simply isn’t one…yet. If it were true and if
  <a href="http://www.macstories.net/news/the-ipod-is-still-strong-grips-76-percent-of-market/">Macstories</a>
  were to correctly slug their posts, or just add a year to the date, the iPod
  commands 76 percent of the market. Wait, lets scrap the numbers game, there
  has been a sizeable crowd spreading rumors about cloud syncing in the next
  iOS. Why couldn’t we connect to our Apple music locker through webdav and
  place mp3’s in it, then sync them back to our iDevice family?</li>
  <li>At 349-430$ these guys are simply too expensive. Tom’s right, those are some
  expensive numbers; however, Google also said that they would lease them at
  20$ for students and 28$ for businesses on a per monthly basis. Wow, 20
  measily bones a month for a laptop when I was in college would have been
  awesome. Plus, after a certain amount of time, Google could send the user a
  brand new laptop and the user would send their old one back to Google. This
  is unconfirmed however, most PC leasing programs reflect this already. 20$ a
  month plus access to new and better hardware when it becomes available?
  Sounds pretty sweet to these ears.</li>
  <li>Ok he has a point here: people aren’t ready for the cloud. Mainly because
  they are pansies, scared that their illegitimate children’s ssn might make
  it back to their current family, or got burned by the recent <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216098/Amazon_outage_sparks_frustration_doubts_about_cloud">Amazon
  outage</a>.
  The fact is, a cloud OS doesn’t mirror the same functionality we are used to
  in our current computer OSs. It lives somewhere else, on someone else’s
  servers, under someone else’s control. You don’t have to worry about
  updates, bugs (Tom thinks different), migrating data to new computers,
  etc…really the list is too long and warrants it’s own post. Just think of
  all the cool stuff you could accomplish if viruses, malware, and updates
  weren’t top of mind?</li>
  <li>Tom thinks the security in ChromeOS is “better, but much worse.” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">Two factor
  authentication</a> is
  where you have a username and password along with a separate numerical
  number that is constantly changing. Once the user imputs a correct username
  and password, they need to imput the random number that is currently marked
  as “valid.” These numbers are usually handed to the user through an app on
  your phone or in the form of a small
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_fob">fob</a>. There are only two applications
  that I use that have this kind of authentication built in: World of Worcraft
  and my <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/advanced-sign-in-security-for-your.html">Google
  account</a>.
  Right Tom…</li>
  <li>“Google can’t do hardware and support.” Yep, this is Tom’s only striking
  point. Does anyone remember the 3g issues that were apparent with the Nexus
  1? Yeah, the big G had a hell of a time getting their <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/01/09/google-nexus-one-support-forums/">support figured
  out</a>.</li>
  <li>“Google gets too much control.” This was taken care of several paragraphs
  before with the words: pansie and porn. Actually, I should just rename this
  whole post to: “Pansies and Porn.”</li>

    <span class="post-date">12 May 2011</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>…today brought forth a story of well,
borific preportions. The wonderful and apparently always sane PR team at
Facebook thought that it would be smart to pitch anti-Google stories to online
newspapers and blogs. The problem was, one of those bloggers didn’t feel like
going along with the whole idea. A few emails later and everyone knows a major
player in the tech industry is hating on Google. Eventually, dealing with
mounting evidence, Facebook issued a statement claiming it was their cockup.</p>

<p>Blogs began picking up the story and before anyone knew it, it was everywhere.
The issue is…who cares? So Facebook happens to hire a PR firm to slander
Google, maybe a little competition is a good thing. Then again, I played rugby
for several years and playing dirty is the only way that game is fun. Facebook
was in the wrong, they got caught, snoring really. Bring on the cooler shit!</p>

    <p>I have a friend, and bless his heart, he loves to hold over my head, my once
intolerant mood towards OS X. It’s true, Tiger (again in my mind) was horrible,
PPC’s were incredibly expensive, and most Mac portables during the early 2000’s
were unreliable and not worth my money. So what did the <del>fashion</del> OS
conscious hipster use back then? For me, it was Linux, and mainly because I had
been using it since around 2000 or when I hit 16.</p>

<p><a href="twitter.com/al3x">Alex Payne</a> wrote a wonderfully eloquent and <a href="http://al3x.net/2008/09/08/al3xs-rules-for-computing-happiness.html">simple
piece</a>
concerning rules for optimal “computing happiness” (something
I care deeply about). The recommendation on
running Mac or Linux in a home and server environment should be a no brainer
for all of us; however, this quote is something that so many of us struggle
	with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use hosted services in lieu of hosting on your own hardware (or virtual hardware) for all but the most custom applications.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, think twice before investing money in bare metal, as well as training
someone on how to run it unless you ABSOLUTELY need it. Think about it and
please <a href="http://al3x.net/2008/09/08/al3xs-rules-for-computing-happiness.html">read Alex’s
