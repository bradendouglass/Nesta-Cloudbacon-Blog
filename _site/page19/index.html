        Constructive Critisism Goes a Long Way
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2012</span>

    <p>Yay, I found this blog again…ok well actually, I have been on a writing hiatus and have recently come
only to yell at the Philladelphians. Yes, you guessed it, those “crasser than myself” general (most, not al)
pain-in-the-neck “Soul fans” have gone and sullied up teh interwebz with what can only be considered hippy, limp
wristed drivel.</p>

<p>Pam, from <a href="http://thewebivore.com/why-you-shouldnt-invite-yehuda-katz-to-your-u">Pam the Webivore</a> decided that it would be her mission…no, her sole duty to attack a fellow ruby
nerd (Yehuda Katz) by getting “flustered” and damning him on Hacker News today. Please, for the love of all that
is good and smells like wet trash in Philly, refrain from using the word flustered outside of people’s interactions
with <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">albatrosses</a>. According to Pam, which is frankly a much better name for her blog, Yehuda steamrolled
someone at a local users group.</p>

<p>Pam made this interaction out to be some kind of barage of sorts, ending with the speaker sitting down because
they couldn’t handle the cricriticism coming from Yehuda. Pam and her Philly-isoms continue to barrate and even
threaten Yehuda for a few more paragraphs. Some might be thinking,  why is Pam and her otherwise lame named blog
such a big deal?</p>

<p>People should call you out when your “shit”(Philladelphianism) could use some improvement. Why let people go through
life thinking their stuff is amazing when a few pieces of critisim could help them tremendously? We have become a
nation of rabbid sycophants and where has it gotten us? This <a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">itis</a> doesen’t affect all of us though. For example, this
week’s <a href="http://5by5.tv/founderstalk/35">Founder’s talk</a> introduced me to Steve Espinosa who feels much the same as I do on this very fact.</p>

<h3 id="a-challenge">A Challenge</h3>

<p>The next time a friend shows you a design, app, idea, etc and they are missing something, tell them. Seriously! Don’t
be afraid to ruffle some feathers, complain, call out the haters, live up to your expectaions, deny something,
whatever! Please, please, don’t passively polish shit.</p>

<p>Also although there might be a hearty portion of Philly jabs in this post, I actually quite adore the city, just
not so much Pam.</p>

      <a href="//2012/02/08/Keep-Time-and-Avoid-Being-Anal/">
        Be Merry, Track Your Time
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2012</span>

    <p>Although somewhat of an anal sport, time tracking and time tracking software
is often times taken for granted by most folks. Even freelancers, the people
who live and die by their output, all judged on a per hour basis, sometimes
neglect the need of quality time tracking. Hopefully this rant will make even
the deepest salary ridden fool think twice when it comes to skimping on starting
that timer.</p>

<h3 id="software-is-dum">Software is Dum</h3>
<p>It really is true. I hadn’t thought about it until now, but there is a possibility
that you could time yourself with a stop watch (IN IRL!!) and record each section
onto some <a href="http://youtu.be/63UlBsdElsY">spreadsheet</a>. Just let that sit in. Uh, and I am 99 percent positive
that some people still do it this way. Don’t fret though, there are some quality
alternatives.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.rescuetime.com/">Rescue Time</a>: Sits in the background and tracks time spent on websites,
documents, etc. Focus mode blocks you from distracting websites. Rescue time is
great to guage how distracted you are during the course of a day.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.slimtimer.com/">Slim timer</a>: Currently my staycation. Lean, simple timer that leans heavily
on a robust and easy to understand tagging system.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.getcashboard.com/">Cashboard</a>: Full featured web client that even takes payments. Much more
than just time tracking.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.getharvest.com/">Harvest</a>: Elephant in the room. Harvest has been around for quite some time
and has a product that is polished and a joy to use. In addition, they have a
dedicated iPhone app.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.toggl.com/">Toggl</a>: On the same lines as Cashboard. Large project with a responsive design
that works well if you mentally split up everything by client, project, tag, workspace
etc.</li>
  <li><a href="http://letsfreckle.com/">Freckle</a>: A gorgeous and fun app written with the idea that all software
should be cheerful and a joy to use. Freckle takes the top design award out of
the bunch. In addition, it is written, designed and marketed by the genius power-
duo: Amy and Thomas at <a href="http://slash7.com/company/">Slash7</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it? Yeah well, this is just a little snippet of what is out there in terms
of web based software. Get your feet wet, find something that fits your lifestyle
and then jump to the next section.</p>

<h3 id="user-error">User Error</h3>
<p>Since all of the above software has some form of payment attached to its use, how
does anyone get what they pay for? First ask yourself, are you using it? Aside
from RescueTime, all of the options above have an elegant and simple way to export
tasks into a csv format for billing. Keyword here being “export”.</p>

<p>There is always (most of the time) the ability to type in a start and end time
for a project. However, this is usually a crap-shoot, which means, if you haven’t
been keeping up, you are undervaluing yourself. All that billable work that is getting completed
but, no one is getting paid. Because someone has timer, “baby” issues.</p>

<p>It’s true. In almost every case, the software comes bundled with a timer that you
can start once you begin working on a project, and stop when you are finished.
This is a much more acurate rendition of the work. The freelancer is no longer
stiffing himself that hour, and he has a much more accurate view of how long it
takes him or her to complete a givien task. Now we are getting paid more AND we
are 100% better when it comes to estimating? BRILLIANT!</p>

<p>Don’t be scared to start that timer. For one, it isn’t going to start its self, nor
is it ever going to be exact unless you do.</p>

<h3 id="less-boring-shit--more-anal">Less Boring Shit != More Anal</h3>
<p>Best headline ever, personally. Anyway, so now that we have a crazy easy and somewhat
scary system put into place to time work, why on earth would we use it outside of
the specific domain? To become a time tracking uber elite, (they are listed next to
the grep uber-elite folks) time tracking must be an integral part of everything you
do.</p>

<p>How much time did I spend on Hacker News yesterday? Well shit, let me fire up
Slim Timer and run a report for you. General RSS and blog reading, blog formulation,
<a href="http://youtu.be/glnJ9lK9FJw">Mr. Pregnant</a>, ALL of it should be tracked. You are not a fun sponge if you
track how much time you “faffe off” on Fbook and Youtube all day. Everytime the
timer starts and it isn’t timing a piece of creation, a small piece of us know that
we need to get back on track.</p>

<p>The pain will subside, but promise yourself that you will track every activity that
is important or that you want to do less of, or that you want to get paid more
for doing…or whatever. Just start that timer and then proceed to do loads of
awesome shit. We certainly could use more “awesome shit” VS useless Reddit posts
about how to be an American and or a minimalist.</p>

        Summary of Potential Readers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>I recently wrote a fascinating <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/posts/12192011-People_Can_Not_Read/">post</a> on the probability of people’s reading skills. With any <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">social inibility</a> comes a good entrepreneur looking to capitalize. Enter some <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/digital-life/smartphone-apps/aussie-wunderkind-gets-us250k-for-technology-that-could-revolutionise-web-20120113-1pz35.html">some 16 year old and a summary sheet</a>. His idea? The ability to summarize text using “clever” algorithms.</p>

<p>Why would allowing people to easily ingest reams of information be a bad thing? Well it isn’t until we become too reliant on the technology. And we as a people would, because it’s easy and endorphins are fun…and make us giddy. We, as readers lose the ability to think critically because we don’t need to, we have algorithms for that. From there we find reading comments difficult because we need to parse more than a few things together in order to devise the scope of the entire conversation. Reading…it’s a bitch.</p>

<p>Yet, that’s the whole point, it’s hard. Writing is as well, just take the time to read a few blog posts around here. In addition, how old is Ben Grubb, who is apparently the “author” of the article? He looks he’s about 2 years short of sprouting his first pubic hair. Man, how I wish I had that level of technology access when I was these kid’s ages. Kudos to them, they will be absolutely ripping when they finally hit puberty.</p>
