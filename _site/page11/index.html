    <p>For everyone who had an unproductive, bad, uninteresting, boring, or
otherwise shitty Friday please click on <a href="http://journeyfriday.com/">this link</a> and spend 13 minutes
basking in what can only be described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big">Pure Fucking Awesome Sauce</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it…for realz! I don’t have anything else to say but:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Lists will tank your time on site.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not much of a google analytics <a href="http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129692">nerd</a> (suriously, I used to love
MTG); however, I thought it would be interesting to see how this
blogging <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a/big">foray</a> has impacted the traffic to this here site.</p>

<p>To my suprise, there has been quite an uptick on visitor front. HOWEVER,
I clicked the compare to time on site and saw the opposite. Although,
there were more people visiting the site, they were quicker to leave,
perhaps because most of the stuff being presented was kinda bland, off
the cough for the past month. This, coupled with the very unedity side
of life is what forced people away.</p>

<p>And this post isn’t going to help much on that front either. Being the
last post of the month I would like to thank all of the people who
attempted to read my ramblings as well as the people who immediately
turned tail and ran away as fast as fucking possible.</p>

    <p>This post will be a <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big">quick and dirty</a> rundown of what is banging
around in my head today.</p>

<h3 id="this-post">This Post</h3>

<p>A couple <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PMU7W3HEbaQ/T8NBPZ66XFI/AAAAAAAABYk/AQCRm7tEoMM/s1600/friendship_kittens.png">good friends</a> and myself have been working to start up a
coworking location <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Z51A_ZeS5_U/UD2YH_wk47I/AAAAAAAA2Ko/Cu4FFmV7e6M/6282012025632iwsmt.jpeg">where we live</a>. Today, there happened to be a
<a href="http://founderware.co/start-up/ten-rules-for-shared-working-spaces/">post</a> make its way to the front page of Hacker news that highlights some
“<a href="https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/dbf5c065a2351c45eff08176351af29716fe7bec687474703a2f2f6769746875622d696d616765732e73332e616d617a6f6e6177732e636f6d2f626c6f672f323031312f6973737565732d6e6578742f746e672e706e67">issues</a> with coworking locations.” I also realized that I have a
twitch when I am focusing really hard. It is a little hard to describe
but, it basically resembles <a href="http://alexgiampapa.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/pickingyournose.jpg">this</a>.</p>

<h3 id="my-car">My Car</h3>

<p>I drive sorta fast. Well my wife wouldn’t say so but I do. Today I
accidently pegged a divet in the road and <a href="http://weknowmemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fuck-you-i-am-cat.jpg">blew a tire</a>. Goodbye 200
dollars. Very sad about this.</p>

<h3 id="current-yobs">Current Yobs</h3>

<p>Yeah, there hadn’t been to much talk about this for some time but, a
week ago I was left with the entire techology sector on my plate. Before
I was more of a programmer than a technologist which has changed very
quickly. When a programmer is saddled with help desk and opperations
based work, they tend to have a hard time switching gears. Or maybe I
just have said problem. This definitely of makes me sad.</p>

<h3 id="my-30-days-blogging">My 30 Days Blogging</h3>

<p>It has been hard, it is over tomorrow, it was hard, but it was well
worth all of the work. I am sure there will be more of a timeframe
between posts going forward but, I am going to make a conscious effort
to make the quality of said posts a whole lot better than the past
month. Hopefully I didn’t drive too many people away.</p>

<h3 id="kindles">Kindles</h3>

<p>It appears that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/30/3280770/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-display">the Verge</a> have gotten their mits on what could be
the new Kindle Fire and e-ink versions. I have been rocking a 2nd
generation Kindle since 09 and definitely like what I am seeing.</p>

<p>It flows better that way…</p>

      <a href="//2012/08/29/A-Programmers-Journal/">
        A Journal
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>If you aren’t quite as <a href="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/21414/screenshots/478981/addicted.jpg">addicted</a> to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker news</a> as most of us
are, this is a reaction to <a href="https://gist.github.com/3444793">this post</a>. In the past few days, the
idea/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Official-Visual-Basic-Programmers-Journal/dp/078970465X?tag=duckduckgo-d-20">topic</a>(HMM…Visual Basic 4, sure brings back <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">memories</a>) of
a programmers journal seems to be gaining steam on the interwebs. The
idea is really quite simple:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Keep a journal of daily things, todos, hang ups, ideas, etc that
pertain to only the world of programming. You can look back on them
and quantify the tragectory of your <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/503258b5aac422d76f000036/big">thought process</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty cool huh? Not sure if it needed to be a block quote but it
happened. The above post really advocates keeping a physical journal (<a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-14-Fun-Found-In-Notecards">as
do I</a>); however, I was quite surprised how many people use text files instead.
Why?</p>

<p>Yes, many programmers are generally concerned about creating a lot of
paper waste. Most of our jobs are designed to rid the workplace of paper
alltogether. This space though, <em>just</em> the programmer’s journal space,
should be filled with great <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340b0029ca154d3d000026/big">physical</a> notebooks. <a href="http://edison.rutgers.edu/">Edison</a>, <a href="http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-books-notebook-from-edison-machine-works-by-nikola-tesla">Tesla</a>, and
<a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/vanWyhe_notebooks.html">Darwin</a> all kept a journal, and I am 99% positive that theirs weren’t
unmanagably long text files. Without further ado, a list. Here are my top requirements for a good,
real, paper programmers journal.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It must be bendy and <a href="http://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_webnotebook.shtml">13x21</a> cm or larger. I have never been a fan
of Moleskine’s notebooks (although the new <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/search?q=zebra+sansa+clip">Evernote one</a> could
be cool) but, their journals are fairly great. The only thing missing
in their exhaustive line is a dot grid option and I would leap on
that in a second if a chance were to arise.</li>
  <li>The notebook should exude creativity but contain the user within a
small grid. That is why lined and blank books don’t really work.
Grids are good and dots are about as good as you can get. <a href="http://www.rhodiapads.com/collections_boutique_webnotebook.shtml">Rhodia</a> has a great product; however,
all of their notebooks have a hard cover. which goes against the
whole idea of “bendy.”</li>
  <li>A great pen and pencil. Yep both! Most of the time I use a <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/search?q=zebra+sansa+clip">pen</a>
from Zebra or <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Hi-Tec-C-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.3-mm-Basic-Colors-Blue-Black/pd/50">Pilot</a> and a lead holder from <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Rotring-300-Lead-Holder-2-mm-Black-Body/pd/8036">Rotring</a>.
Experiment and find what you like in your hands.</li>
</ol>

<p>As I mentioned yesterday, it is hard to incorporate something new, and
perhaps difficult into your daily routine. With a notebook, slide it
between your <a href="http://www.elitekeyboards.com/">keyboard</a> and monitor. That way it is always in the
way of you and your creativity.</p>

<p>Fin…just promise me: “Don’t use a fucking text file for your
programming journal”</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2012</span>

    <p><a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">Pants</a>, if for some reason you don’t know what goes in them.</p>

<p>Life is surprisingly <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/503abec229ca15f37500000d/big">easy</a>, which happens to be contrary to most of
the <a href="http://8.mshcdn.com/wp-content/gallery/amercia/%40warpafx.jpg">jowels out there</a>. What <em>is</em> hard is doing <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340b0029ca154d3d000026/big">shit</a>
consistently. Every day to be exact.</p>

<p>The plan was to keep this <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big">post</a> squared away until the very end of
this little test. An experiment to try and write <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-02-30-Days-of-Blogging">1 post every day</a>
for the month of August. Posts could be on a myriad of subjects but,
they all had to be &gt; 200 words and posted during the hours of each
day.</p>

<p>It isn’t Friday, which happens to the <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=official&amp;tbs=imgo:1&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=828&amp;sei=IHM9UNmJEoym8ATepIGoDw">official</a> end of the month
but, here are some really quick reflections on doing <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">one thing, every day</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It’s hard. Being able to produce 200 words of prose each day is super
easy. Making said prose make a lick of sense or even be <a href="http://www.memlane.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Apple-Remote-01.jpg">remotely</a>
interesting is pretty fucking hard.</li>
  <li>Use a product like OmniFocus or <a href="https://hollyapp.com/">Holly</a> to list out ideas as they
come by. I did this more at the beginning and got laxed towards the
end which has been the result of a lot of <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big">lists</a></li>
  <li>When you first sit down at a desk everyday, open your daily post and
work on it throughout the day. Inevitably the post will be better
than cramming it into 1 hour at night.</li>
  <li>Build in one cheat day. I didn’t do this and I am glad that I didn’t.
However, there will be a time where you are away from a computer and
have no way to properly construct a post. No one is a failure if they
miss one day.</li>
  <li>Make it fun.</li>
  <li>Teach</li>
</ol>

<p>Fin.</p>

    <p>If you don’t know what <a href="http://www.codejacked.com/know-your-keyboard-bang-splat-whack/">splat</a> means than you are in the wrong
place. If you do! Well <a href="http://25.media.tumblr.com/8tqDWct6W70gfanxSJXIGOMO_500.jpg">huzzah</a> (possibly NSFW), keep reading. It
happens to be a <a href="http://strictlystrengthproject.com/wp-content/uploads/HappyMon.jpg">Monday</a>, and Mondays happen to proceed the epically
boring Sunday. Equally boring, Mondays are rife for some positive <a href="http://teuxdeux.com/">list
production</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike a few weeks ago, where we looked at some small things that were
going on in the community, today we will run <a href="http://www.everythingaction.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/2003_the_rundown_020.jpg">down the opposite</a>.
Without going too much into depth (wouldn’t want to spoil it), here are
just a few things “<a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I+could+give+two+shits">I couldn’t be bothered to give two shits</a>“…about.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://news.google.com/news?ned=us&amp;q=twitter%20api&amp;btnG=Search+News">Twitter’s New TOS</a>: Or API changes, or whatever. When it comes
down to it, a small fraction of people actually use Twitter. In
addition, an <strong>EVEN</strong> smaller section know what a 3rd party app is.
<a href="http://us5.memecdn.com/How-I-feel-about-America_c_66102.jpg">Google ++,</a> Twitter is the new Facebook, everyone wants to <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big">hate on it</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2012/08/articles/attorney/patent-infringement/apple-v-samsung/">Apple V Samsung’s Big Knobby Vibrator</a>: Suriously, there is so
much to link to, I just dumped something in there. There was a
verdict, now someone is crying, so there isn’t now. Who the fuck
cares. Oh, one more thing, Samsung and all of their <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2012/08/27/youve-seen-apples-internal-memo-to-employees-on-the-verdict-now-heres-samsungs/">letters</a>.
Actually, if Fortune 500’s could just <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/Portals/175832/images/office-space-boss1.jpg">quit with the memos</a> all
together, that would <a href="http://youlooknicetoday.com/">be nice</a></li>

<p>Ok and here are some things to coutneract <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big">all that negativity</a></p>
