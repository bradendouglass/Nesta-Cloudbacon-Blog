    <p><strong>TWO</strong> posts in one day!!! Anyway, not really. No need to get your
hopes up so high you shit yourself. Nah, this is just a quick blurb
about some cool things you can do with the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1764263/what-is-the-leader-in-a-vimrc-file">leader key</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run some tests</li>
  <li>Switch to a Rails controller, view, or model</li>
  <li>Search through a list of files</li>
  <li>Search through a list of buffers</li>
  <li>Open a command to be piped to a specific tmux window</li>
  <li>Open a visual tree-list of all files in the current director</li>
  <li>Turn a line into a comment</li>
  <li>Switch the case of an entire word</li>
  <li>Show a list of ctags</li>
  <li>Do git legwork</li>
</ol>

<p>…and so much more. Yeah, Leader is pretty much my power animal.</p>

        Being Healthy And A Programmer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>OH yes sir(and/or/maybe mam), it is completely doable. Since the <a href="http://www.talkmovie.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Tron-Legacy3.jpg">dawn of
the programmer</a>, we have been portrayed as fairly <a href="http://tubulocity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/fat_cyclist.jpg">portly</a> dweebs
who exist in a <a href="http://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/sitting-kills/">chronic sitting position</a>. While this has been true
in the past, and surely is at the <a href="http://diabetic-calendar.com/">moment</a> (who the fuck would even purchase a diabetic calendar - tres bizarre), we can do a lot to help
ourselves stay healthy while still doing what we <a href="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi">absolutely love</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.lenovo.com/images/uploads/hero/TopView_T430s_crop.jpg">Change is hard</a>(it really is sad about Lenovo moving to chicklet stylz), especially when it comes to the food we shove in our
<a href="http://wildomarmagazine.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/shut_your_pie_hole.jpg">pie-holes</a>. However, programmers are accustom to change. They pivot
constantly, change their working environments and generally don’t have a
problem with this…right? Keeping this easy then, let’s just stop
eating carbohydates and sugar. Pretty easy huh?</p>

<p>No carbs and no sugars means no <a href="http://punchfork.com/recipes/spaghetti%20squash">spaghetti</a>, pasta, bread, muffins,
cakes, any of it. To make this transition easy, follow this rule six out
of seven days in the week (one day off). Ok, so why right? Well sugar
and carbs force your pancreas to <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/481929-increased-blood-sugar-weight-gain/">produce a lot of insulin</a> which
will inevitably lead to diabetes and weight gain. Both of these things,
if you are lost, are bad.</p>

<p>And that’s it? Yep! Well…actually, give a <a href="http://smarterware.org/7102/how-and-why-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk">standing desk</a> a whirl.
They can be hard to get used to; however, are great for your posture,
back strength, legs, etc in the long run. If you are worried about
standing all day (it is hard at first) find one that auto-magically
moves up and down. They are expensive but will add years onto the
backend of your life in order for you to continue to do what you love
well into your old age. Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">forth</a> and be a healthy, kick-ass
programmer!</p>

    <span class="post-date">10 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>OK, rule number one (don’t use “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense">of thumb</a>”), avoid trying to jump
people away from the <a href="http://punchfork.com/recipes/meat%20and%20potatos">meat-and-potatoes</a> of a blog post before they even
start reading. AKA the link in the summary field, did you even click it?
Why not?</p>

<p>Anyway, I hack at my workflows almost constantly. If it isn’t reading,
or programming, you can bet that I am looking to do something way <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">better
than yesterday.</a> Since this post will end up being a <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">list</a> (hey, they
are super easy to write), most of the workflow will be center around
gui applications and not my overall crack-addiction to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a>.
Without, further <a href="http://billdaviswords.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/nothing-to-say-so-blog.gif">ado</a>, be prepared for <a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uWWqnrjrBzY/T663Ukikk6I/AAAAAAAACzg/0vV_K9qYbZk/wisdom-be-fearful-of-mediocrity.jpg">negative-mediocrity</a>!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Yes, I run all of my <a href="http://bigweek.co/">big ticket</a> applications in Lion and
Mountain Lion’s full screen mode. These are generally Chrome Canary,
Iterm2, and OmniFocus…sometimes Rdio. This also means that I
<em>don’t</em> use a double monitor setup. I find them distracting and
overall a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">UX clusterfuck</a>.</li>
  <li>I am an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmonad">Xmonad</a> freak and wish there was something more like it
available for the OS X. To get around this I use a launcher named
<a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>. Alfred has an extension named <a href="http://projects.jga.me/layouts/">layouts</a> to control
your windows and I assign cmd + option + # to apps I want to switch
to quickly. This means that if I want to quickly navigate to Chrome,
I can hit cmd + option + 2 instead of command-tabing there or using
the mouse.</li>
  <li>Vim (<a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-07-Leave-Macvim-To-The-Noobz">NOT FUCKING MACVIM</a>) + Tmux for <a href="http://us13.memecdn.com/finish-him_gp_205003.jpg">combo</a> awesome-sauce.
This allows 1 iTerm2 window to stay open in full screen (with only
two “iTerm” style tabs: tmux + bitlbee/irc server for chatting)
and act as many different terminals through the power inherent in Tmux. In addition, some people seem to
have a-beef with Tmux’s copy and paste mode…<a href="https://github.com/ChrisJohnsen/tmux-MacOSX-pasteboard">I don’t</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://nial.me/2011/12/houdini-to-appear-in-the-mac-app-store/">Houdini</a> is a free app that will hide away inactive items when a
certain time limit is hit. The idea being that you have one constant,
clean workspace. You cmd+tab(I use tab+q because those two items are generally close) to an app that isn’t important enough to
be full screen (thereby taking up a workspace) but, something you want
to use later. This keeps the one “open” workspace free and
clear of open/front-facing/distracting apps.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this is a little much to take in so if you have any questions hit
me up on the Twitters. Overall though, it works fairly well, the only
thing that I wish for was a smart window tiling manager, ala Xmonad.
<a href="http://www.tylerwm.com/">Tyler</a> seems like a good option for this; however, it doesn’t seem
to function on Mountain Lion and it is long-in-the-tooth when it comes
to a substantial upgrade…We shall see.</p>

    <p>Yeah, why the fuck <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_mcMJ_B_hD0U/TKhNgFPsQWI/AAAAAAAAAR8/ZAtFQwauQvg/s1600/archer.jpg">not</a>? How have we gotten to the point where we
simply accept <a href="http://www.davidforbes.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/ie-devil_03.jpg">shitty software</a> (although I hear number 10 is way
<a href="http://www.inspireux.com/wp-content/uploads/310.gif">good</a>)? Do you get all giddy when you sit down in the morning and
turn on Outlook and Office? I happen to work with several of <a href="http://cdn1.benzinga.com/files/crazypeople.jpg">these
peoples</a> and all I hear <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">spew from their mouths</a> each morning are
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Groan-Up-Newark-Nebraska-ebook/dp/B005OC2V8I/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344561738&amp;sr=8-5&amp;keywords=groan+up">groans</a>(I swear it is sorta a true story).</p>

<p>Yeah…well, again, why the <em>fuck</em> do people ship anything but happiness?
Is it hard, sure but, why on earth would you go through the trouble for a
few quick bucks? And, guarenteed it will be a measly few. People usually
don’t contine to buy shitty software if it continues to exude shit…
Wait, no that’s not right.</p>

<p>Look at <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">Microsoft</a> and basically everything they make. It is defined
by how much hapiness it <a href="http://thisthatandtheotherthang.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/funny-pictures-kitten-and-puppy-watch-a-scary-movie-together.jpg">sucks from people</a> and yet people continue
to <a href="http://www.nataliedee.com/051209/FUN-FACT-i-use-that-shit-to-wash-my-face.jpg">use this shit</a> without question. How do we fix this? Just fucking
stop building shitty things and pump the market with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time">fuck-ton</a> of
happiness. Because, really? What else is needed?</p>

<p>I apologize for the lack of love in these posts lately. I need to
stretch their formation out over the day (VS when I get home from it) and hope it solves this
issue. No guarentees promised, pre-haps a little bit of alcohol is all
that is needed.</p>

        Distrust The Magic
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>If you spend enough time working with computers there is a good chance
you might <a href="http://tremendousnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/drunk-urinal.jpg">stumble</a> onto some <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GTXZyOmzHaA/TfHMTu4JfOI/AAAAAAAAAzo/BQ7pgmBblno/s1600/finkle_630x_2.jpg">magic</a>. This doesn’t mean that you
might randomly see unicorns while tracking down your next <a href="https://www.airtime.com/">porn-s-cipade</a>,
frankly this is normal. No, the magic that will be reamed on, neglected,
yelled at, and belabored for the rest of this post is that of utter
<a href="http://www.hovding.com/en/how">deception</a>.</p>

<p>Programmers are really good at hiding away all the hard things in this
magic. They wrap it up in little quiant boxes, with buttons and
checkboxes that…“just work.” We see this with Windows Server.
Everything is just a click away, all along while the user has no idea
how to actually <strong>DO</strong> any of it. In their mind they build a network of
roads, all of which lead to desired solutions. We don’t know how the
roads are leveled, what goes into the mixture, how they are laid, etc.
We just know how to use them.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://berkutschi.com/assets/images/news/000/005/334/thumb500/nor_velta.jpg?1342704744">blessing</a>, wrapped in an duck all shoved into a
wonderful <a href="http://supershopsite.com/product_image/Pet/merrick-turducken-dog-food-case-of-24-55oz-cans.jpg">enema</a>. This cripples us. We don’t understand how any of
the underlying items fuction or how they interact with each other to
<em>actually</em> make something work. Rails, Windows, OS X, all of it should
be rooted through, explored, tested, and ultimately broken. Set up
environments, test, test, test, and more important than anything:
<a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">attempt to do your worst</a>.</p>

<p>This is a really complex topic, one that can’t be put to justice with
just one post. The plan? Extrapolate the magic further and smatter it
throughout a couple more posts. Come back tomorrow…or whatever.</p>
