    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Not many people know this but, I am a <a href="http://www.dvhardware.net/news/aerocool_top_gun.jpg">huge fan</a> of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1130988/">this
movie</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382?tag=duckduckgo-d-20">this book</a>. Since this happens to be less of a blog
about movies and more on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/AruKI.jpg">self help</a> and software engineering, lets
tackle the latter. Although, if you are feeling particularly
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/AruKI.jpg">bored tonight</a>, do rent the movie.</p>

<p>Breaking shit! Alright, so guessing that you didn’t pick up the book?
Right, <a href="http://toolsandtoys.net/">breakable toys</a> refers to a piece of code/application/software
that is <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340aa129ca15433d000010/big">near and dear to the your heart</a> yet, perhaps not
“<a href="http://youtu.be/xP1-oquwoL8">mission critical</a>” to the client. The authors of Apprenticeship
Patterns (or AP for shortzies) talk a lot about building these toy
systems in <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big">isolation</a>, or private. I love this ‘pattern’ but, I
think there exists a better spin to the whole design in isolation idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Design in production</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all have <a href="http://storieswritingadventure.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/damien_canderle_gremlins2.jpg">little problems</a> that could be easily solved,
quantified, or tracked using some kind of application. Focus that need
and build a breakable toy. It doesn’t have to be <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/503258b5aac422d76f000036/big">complex</a>, or even all
that great, just build it. Once it is finished, iterate by bringing
someone on to help its inevitable design wonkyness or just keep adding
features through user stories. The main verbs being: build, deploy,
iterate, test and perhaps most important of all: <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a/big">break</a>.</p>

<p>Well…most important of all might go to actually reading AP. Really, read
the book, you can thank me later</p>

        Fuck The 80/20 Rule
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Do you know what all this <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big">80/20</a> shit is about? If not feel free to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">go here</a> and be <a href="https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large">enlightened</a>. Don’t get me wrong, the rule works
real well when used in the vertical that is business. 80% of your
terrible experiences come from 20% of your customers. <a href="http://youtu.be/n-mpifTiPV4">I get it</a>, I
really do. The problem lies when the 80/20 rule is used in this domain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will make 80% of my time perfect and the other 20 can be “whatever”,
or “meh”, or “shit”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People pull this <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big">stunt</a> with diets, excersise, getting things done,
everything. Again, I understand! No one is perfect and as you <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">approach
perfection, actual perfection becomes harder and harder to attain</a>.
My <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f67e29ca154572000000/big">beef</a> with the idea stems from the <a href="http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random">lazy factor</a>. People, with
diligence and some elbow grease could iron out that unwieldy 20%
eventually.</p>

<p>Yet they don’t. They idly stand by and watch <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f2bf29ca153c71000025/big">life fly by them</a>, all
while assuming what they are doing is <a href="http://www.nypost.com/rw/nypost/2012/02/24/news/web_photos/24.1n008.gop--300x300.jpg">A-OK</a>. Since this is my blog
and apparently the way things are going these days, advice column, this
is a good way to <a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">break out</a> of the aforementioned
<a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">mediocrity</a>…Don’t do it.</p>

<p>You were beting on a list <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a">weren’t you</a>? Nope. If you are sucking
20% of the time today, suck 19% tomorrow. <a href="http://media-files.gather.com/images/d336/d43/d746/d224/d96/f3/full.jpg">Whittle</a> away at it at
your own pace but, promise me, never be happy with the number 20.</p>

<p>In closing: butter sculptures will never count for the 20%</p>

    <p><a href="http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random">Genuis</a>! This post will be a rundown of all of the recent <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">tech-shit</a>
that has been <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big">dominating</a> the news for the past month. Most of the
items that will be <a href="http://imgur.com/FHWMO">listed</a>(I know, most people despise them), will be
subjects that aren’t worth an entire post. Without further <a href="http://www.adodarts.com/">ado</a>, lets
get this rollin’.</p>

<h3 id="appnet">App.net</h3>

<p>I have refrained from talking about <a href="https://join.app.net/">Dalton</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/jcrclarksonesq/status/235397285167656962/photo/1/large">ridiculously</a>
named “App.net” due to my “unnease” with the whole project. I am a huge
fan of Twitter yet, not what they are pulling at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/08/16/twitter-drop-dead">the moment</a> with their
developers. After listening to a <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/enough/">few podcasts</a> on the subject, the
fact that you can export all of your “updates” in plain-text is really
interesting. I could <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=i%20could%20give%20two%20shits&amp;defid=6196142">give two shits about</a> moah characters (200 something),
lack of third party application support, or being the hip thing to do.
If App.net can deliver, I will throw my 50 dollars at them per year. It
may be a steap price but, it is worth it for the peace of mind</p>

<h3 id="ms-surface">MS Surface</h3>

<p>For the people who <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en/us/default.aspx">don’t know</a> (which is probably a good amount of
you). The keyboard is dumb, the prie point is unknown and it will run
<a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/microsoft-banning-apps-metro-windows-8-store-windows-phone-next">Metro</a>…OOPs, probably going to get sued for that. Microsoft needs to
stick to what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP">they do best</a> and forget about following
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/tablet-islate-ipad-netbook-notebook,9929.html">trends</a>.</p>

<h3 id="facebook-stock">Facebook Stock</h3>

<p>Really? Who bought <a href="http://jeffreyhill.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d417153ef017c31595837970b-800wi">this stuff</a>? Let it tank, and let the people who
thought they were buying into Google in 1998 go with it.</p>

<h3 id="apple-vs-samsung">Apple VS Samsung</h3>

<p>Anyone in their right mind knows to give the <a href="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b012877707dd5970c-pi">whole patent</a> thing 0
percent of their time.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the fish!</p>

        Cucumber 101
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>I know it is pretty fucking cliched; however, it is hard to go through a
<a href="http://www.rubythreads.com/products/tatft">Ruby day</a> without some <a href="http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random">surious</a> testing. That’s right, if you
don’t know what “TATFT” means than you haven’t been doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship">craftsmen</a>
level software development for all that long. In this post we are going
to take a newly formed [[Rails]] application and get it up to speed with
some simple <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> style tests. In addition, this will be my
first software based post, which is kind of exciting…I think.</p>

<p>The first thing that needs to be done is cracking open that <a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">Gemfile</a>
and let’s add in these lines:</p>

<p><code>ruby
group :test do
  gem 'cucumber-rails', :require =&gt; false
  gem 'capybara-webkit'
  gem 'database_cleaner'
end
</code></p>

<p>If you are one of <a href="http://imgur.com/FHWMO">those people</a> who feel the need to place version
numbers in your Gemfile, go ahead. As an aside, I recommend NOT doing
this. Use your Gemfile.lock and your version control <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/bundler">du jour</a> to
keep gem versions inline with your dev and production platforms.</p>

<p>The three gems you added into your Rails application are as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>[[Cucumber-rails]] adds all the requires into your app where needed. A
<code>rails g cucumber:install</code> will also need to be run after bundle
installing the above gems.</li>
  <li>Database cleaner will cleanse your test environment after each test.</li>
  <li>Capybara-webkit is a handy gem for running <code>@javascript</code> tagged tests
in a <a href="http://images3.makefive.com/images/entertainment/books/top-5-harry-potter-characters/nearly-headless-nick-7.jpg">headless environment</a>. It does require you download/compile
QT-Webkit; however, this is a breeze with Homebrew (it is listed as
‘qt’)</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you finnish installing QT (Tested on 10.8.0 @2012.08.18 and working
great) you should head over to <code>/railsAppRoot/features/support/env.rb</code> and add in this
string:</p>

<p><code>ruby
Capybara.javascript_driver = :webkit
</code></p>

<p>And VOILA! You are ready to start testing! For a handy way to run
commands/tests, using <a href="http://henican.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/scared-baby.jpg">command line</a> Vim and Tmux, read <a href="http://henrik.nyh.se/2012/07/tests-on-demand-using-vimux-and-turbux-with-spork-and-guard/">this post</a>
by someone way smarter than myself. Keep your eyes peeled for another
post on Cucumber stories and how to write reusable yet sensible tests in
your Rails app.</p>

this directly affects the quality of this post, no <a href="http://img.izismile.com/img/img5/20120625/640/sweating_profusely_isnt_so_bad_640_04.jpg">one cares</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-setup">The Setup</h3>

<p>The break out sessions begins at your local <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Qc5xdld0vwQ/S8cjXiGz6qI/AAAAAAAAANs/FZO1bxnuHmY/s1600/Halo2_Lan.jpg">hack knight</a> and you are
attending by yourself. What do you <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">do</a>? Surrounded by people who you
only <a href="http://youtu.be/T5ictPToU9M">assume are smahter than yourself</a> (yes smart is spelled
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_accent#Vowels">correctly</a>), you freeze, lock up and choke under pressure. Nothing
like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfie">these people though</a> though…“colloquial term” <strong>LEVEL UP</strong>!</p>

<p>See! You are already a few steps ahead; however, you hold yourself back
because of some, or all of the below reasons (don’t hate, Friday may as
well be one <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/4f6692412f0aaaf647000004/big">big list day</a>).</p>

</ol>

<p>With that, we are done here. A couple really sweet tips that have taken
me a long way that definitely couldn’t hurt. Check out a recent talk by
an awesome person named: <a href="http://coreyhaines.com/">Corey Haines</a>. Its first run was while he was
visiting Steel City Ruby Conf in Pittsburgh this year. I could have
sworn Confreaks was there so keep refreshing until it shows up. It is
well worth the 30 minutes of your time. And, finally the moment that kareoke
machine is brought out, you be the first to the mike. Yep…win!</p>
