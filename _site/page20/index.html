        Flinch For Your Life

    <span class="post-date">05 Jan 2012</span>

    <p>How many times during the day do you think that you flinch? Well, lets change
that around a bit. How man times a day do you put yourself into a situation
where you might flinch? We, as the inhabitants of the
“<a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">US</a>” love
security. Nice houses, confy jobs where we sit behind a computer and appear to
be doing quality, work. What has all of this confort given us? Better health?
<a href="http://www.gohealthinsurance.com/blog-resources/american-health-care-info/">Nope</a>,
better retirement? <a href="http://jobs.aol.com/articles/2011/12/15/most-employees-not-prepared-for-retirement-infographic/">Definitely
not</a>.
What then?</p>

<p>Nothing actually. The equation is really quite simple (10-30 somethings) == (a
bunch of video-game players). Even NPR…well ok, the really cool guys at
Freakonomics Radio are making
<a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/01/04/why-is-%E2%80%9Ci-don%E2%80%99t-know%E2%80%9D-so-hard-to-say-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/">quips</a>
at the youth and their love of video games. Without experienceing situations
that scare us, how can we grow mentally and physically? Julien Smith’s new book:
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=flinch&amp;tag=alfredapp-20">Flinch</a>
answers this very question.</p>

<p>Julien is definitely onto something with the idea of shortcircuiting our cronic
avoidance of fear. If, like our gag reflex, we could increase our abilities to
withstand difficult situations, what would this world look like? What do you
think? The book is free on amazon (kindle) and worth the 3 seconds it will take
you to click on the buy now button. Seriously, go read it…if you

        Angry NYC Ruby Devs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Dec 2011</span>

    <p>The interesting blog: <a href="http://www.betabeat.com/">Betabeat</a> highlighted a
wonderful
<a href="http://www.betabeat.com/2011/12/27/ruby-developers-offended-by-2800-ruby-class/">cockup</a>
by <a href="http://art.sy/about">Art.sy</a>’s main programming squeeze, <a href="https://twitter.com/dblockdotorg">Daniel
Doubrovkine</a>. In short, he began a thread on
the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/messages/archive/">NYC-rb</a> mailing list and
like any other <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">Internetz shit storm</a>, things got
bad fast.</p>

<p>Feel free to look at the whole thread by visiting NYC-rb mailing list
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/messages/archive/">here</a>. The replys seem to be
under the heading “RoR class for developers @GA in January”. Just search for
the heading and an amass of articles should show themselves.</p>

<p>My thoughts on the whole kurfuffle is as follows. Developers learn by testing
and trying thousands of different platforms. Some of us learn languages better
by grabbing several books off the shelf, others excel much quicker in a
classroom/team setting (I usually fall under the latter). This <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/ruby-on-rails-for-developers">specific
class</a> is 2800$ which
seems like a lot… until you look at some interesting aspects.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> and <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal
Labs</a>, two well known and exceptional Ruby and Rails
shops are backing the project. Does this mean that both will cherry pick a
couple of hungry devs from the class? Perhaps. However, if you are looking for
a reason to get into a classroom with a bunch of brilliant people who might
offer you a job at the end, why balk at the opportunity? In addition, the
classes are 4 hours a week across two days. Which is potentially comparable
with time spent on a 4 credit College course</p>

<p>The software craftsmanship / apprentice pattern seems to be here to stay.
College and higher education is a stagnant game and companies like Engine Yard,
Pivotal, and LivingSocial seem to be looking to help out the community by
alternative means. There will be bumps along the road, but I(my opinion) don’t
feel like this class is one of them.</p>

      <a href="//2011/12/20/Command-T-Sucks/">
        Get Rid Of Command T
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Dec 2011</span>

    <p>Hardcore text editors always seem to make a concerted effort to actually ease
the opening of different files. Perhaps the most elegant solution was
implemented by <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> by hitting Command-T. A drawer would open
from the top of the window, the user could begin typing in the name of a file
and eventually hit enter to open it. Other editors have exibited this
functionality and the guys and gals at <a href="http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen">PeepCode</a> even built a handy
app that sits in your menu bar to do the same thing.</p>

<p>If you were a Vim/MacVim/GVim user you had one of two choices to mimic this
functionality.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the PeepOpen application which is pretty cool and definitely worth the
  money, although it requires a plugin to function with Vim</li>
  <li>Use a plugin (<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1502">Vimball</a> in this case) named Command-T</li>
</ol>

<p>The issue with Command-T came down to the fact that it needed to be compiled
with the system Ruby and so did your version of MacVim. Well, that’s cool, most
people are ok with using OS X’s version of Ruby because it is up-to-date…wait,
nope! For the intelligent person using <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv">RBENV</a>, you needed to make sure to switch off from Ruby 1.9.2 and back
to the system ruby when updating MacVim via <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> or compiling
the <a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim">source</a>.</p>

<p>All of this was a serious pain in the ass, trip-plicated by the fact that
MacVim is yet to see a golden, stable release for 10.7. In the most simple of
cases, plugins can be installed by throwing a couple of files and a doc
file(help text) into their respected folders. This action is what makes using
<a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a>(Yes I know it is somewhat frowned upon but I don’t happen to
care, <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/R_5tFHW0prI/AAAAAAAAB-4/YWb6ZKvtFTY/s1600/haters-1.jpg">sorry</a>) such an easy package manager. However, if you look how <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus/blob/master/Rakefile">it
handles</a> Command-t you should be instantly filled with complex waves
of hatred or…at least <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">this</a>.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">CTRLP</a>! An elegant and easily installable solution that could
care less about your Ruby implementation. After just a day and a half of random
playing, I am thoroughly impressed and suspect that Command-T won’t make it’s
way back into my <a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">Vim belt</a>. Although, I have massive respect for
the Vim user who keeps trying to wrestle the beast.</p>

<p>Download CTRLP from the <a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">githubs</a>, add it to your .janus.rake file
with:  <script src="https://gist.github.com/2644583.js?file=old style"></script> …or use your Vim package manager of choice.</p>

        People Can't Read

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2011</span>

    <p>If you happened to stumble across Cloudbacon this morning, you have witnessed
a slight change to the sidebar. Before, it simply read “CB” (CloudBacon for
the peeps who had yet to figure it out) and a relatively cruddy icon for the RSS
feed. Now, you are greeted with three separate icons. One, a cloud, Two, a piece of
8-bit bacon, and lastly, a punch out of the weird RSS thing.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons for this change:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I was kinda bored, ok? It happens.</li>
  <li>There is a high likelyhood that people can’t read:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2011/05/04/report-nearly-half-of-detroiters-cant-read/">Here</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.life360.com/blog/rich-americans-cant-read-peoples-emotions/">Here</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://thestir.cafemom.com/food_party/129526/white_coke_cans_pulled_because">And Here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Really these are just a few, it’s ridiculous actually.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can’t read, THUMBS UP, you know where you are, yet you might not be able
to do too much else from here…including reading this. Anyway, if you absolutely
dislike the whole <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconography">iconographic</a> thing,
feel free to send me some FUD at braden[at]buyurifemme{dot}com.</p>

<p>In finishing this up, there are a lot of articles built into my backlog, so they
might be on their way out but, really no one knows. At most, don’t hold your breath.</p>
