    <blockquote>
  <p>I can’t even say what’s wrong with PHP, because— okay. Imagine you have uh, a toolbox. A set of tools. Looks okay, standard stuff in there.
You pull out a screwdriver, and you see it’s one of those weird tri-headed things. Okay, well, that’s not very useful to you, but you guess it comes in handy sometimes.
You pull out the hammer, but to your dismay, it has the claw part on both sides. Still serviceable though, I mean, you can hit nails with the middle of the head holding it sideways.
You pull out the pliers, but they don’t have those serrated surfaces; it’s flat and smooth. That’s less useful, but it still turns bolts well enough, so whatever.
And on you go. Everything in the box is kind of weird and quirky, but maybe not enough to make it completely worthless. And there’s no clear problem with the set as a whole; it still has all the tools.
Now imagine you meet millions of carpenters using this toolbox who tell you “well hey what’s the problem with these tools? They’re all I’ve ever used and they work fine!” And the carpenters show you the houses they’ve built, where every room is a pentagon and the roof is upside-down. And you knock on the front door and it just collapses inwards and they all yell at you for breaking their door.
That’s what’s wrong with PHP.</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2013</span>

    <p>Before you blow your precious time on this post, feel free to listen to this
<a href="http://www.70decibels.com/mikesonmics/2013/2/1/episode-53-a-productive-argument-with-matt-alexander.html">podcast</a> <strong>AND</strong> then come back and finish reading. Done? Ok, great. My takeaway
was that my “productive” life is filled with all kinds of tangents. Most, never
diverge back into anything. They remain un-attended appendages, dangling in my
mind until some unforseen force lops them off.</p>

<p>Being the <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50730705aac422613b000001/big">tinkerer</a> I am, I set out to rid myself of all the estraneous shit
that has plagued my <a href="http://www.doitfuckingnow.com/">GSD</a> system for the past year.
In doing so, I ended up with three objects that will be an integral part of my
productivity strides in 2013. And without further ado, a <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">list</a>:</p>

<h3 id="irl">IRL</h3>

<p>For the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lamen+terms">lamen</a> in the room, IRL is broken down nicely <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRL">here</a>, especially
the second definition. Anywho, this by far is the category with the most stuff in
it. The most being two.</p>

<h4 id="field-notes5">1. <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/">Field Notes</a>:</h4>

<p>I have always struggled to fit Field Notes and the smaller
Moleskines into my life. They seem just small enough where I struggle to get
anything coherent into them. Moreover, there are little times where I raise pen to
paper and don’t write an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_10?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=mitchener&amp;sprefix=bosch+icon%2Caps%2C162">epic novella</a>. By holding onto the fact that anything placed into
these little guys must be brilliant, I almost never actually write anything in them.
They just take up way too much space around the house and eventually, the wife
ends up throwing them out or using them to write down grocery lists.</p>

<p>Where the thought of a grocery list in them used to revolt me, I have begun to use
them in the same fashion. They aren’t a recepticle for the next Odyssey, they are
a utilitarian piece of paper. Once I got this wrapped around my head, their use
has become all the more apparent. I throw variables that I need to remember in there,
the three big things I need to do today, really whatever. At the end of the week,
when my review comes around I pull the current one out and flip through it, jotting
down anything that needs to be remembered. Very freeing, and with the Field Notes brand
going bannanas these days, it is easy to find a <a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/">cedar recepticle</a> to store your used ones in.</p>

<h4 id="levengerbehance-circa-book6">2. <a href="http://www.creativesoutfitter.com/product/29/action-circa-notebook">Levenger/Behance Circa Book</a>:</h4>

<p>This is a recent puchase that was more of a whim, than anything. Having never
subscribed to the action method, I had no idea what I was getting into. The draw was
that the book itself is refillable and dot paper is the shit. After using it for
a couple of weeks it has a place in my life that is more permanent than a Field Notes
book. I am more apt to use each page on a project by project base and link everything
together with a <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/12/05/how-to-take-notes-like-an-alpha-geek-plus-my-2600-date-challenge/">table of contents</a>. There isn’t as much feedom as with the
Field Notes, however this notebook doesn’t tend to travel far from my workbench. In addition,
I enjoy the paper size and tend to doodle and draw in-between notes, where space
is at a premium with the Field Notes.</p>

<h3 id="digital">Digital</h3>

<p>This one is easy: <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a>. I spent a good amount of time in 2009 in an
attempt to fit Omnifocus into my workflow. The idea of GTD was simple however,
and this is something I can’t comprehend now, Omnifocus just didn’t gel. It was always
a struggle to get information into the program along with organizing it once it was there.
2 Years later in 2011 I was doing a small side project and it all clicked.</p>

<p>Ever since, I have put my faith in Omnigroup both on the iPad and the iPhone.
Due to the high amount of content already available about this application, I am
going to keep things light and say that yes, it is complicated but, very much
worth it. Once you grep the overall workflow I doubt you will go back to a
“simpler” solution. Moreover, the Omnigroup has <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/blog/entry/debut-of-omnifocus-2">recently announced</a> Omnifocus 2
which means that they plan to align the Mac version with the much more updated <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus-iphone/">mobile
variants</a></p>

<h3 id="fin">Fin</h3>

<p>These three arms have kept my mind free to creativly think about upcoming projects
as well as keep everything considered “current,” on track. Things will probably change, they always do,
rest assured, I might write about it.</p>

        Show Yourself Off
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2013</span>

    <p>Getting crazy ideas usually leads people down the road to a lot of fun, yet
potentially wasted amounts of time. This is how creativity is formed. And this
writer is no different. I happened to be bored one night and thought:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>how difficult is it for people to get a grasp on how “haphazardly good” a particular programmer might be.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any company or recruiter could dig through the expanse of <a href="https://github.com/bradendouglass">our Github</a>
profiles but, we usually hoard so much weird stuff in there. In addition, they
are rife with forks that we never took the time to do anything with. If Github
doesn’t accomplish their needs then do they move on to the developers blogs? Many of these
are digital wastelands, filled with confusing UI, large images of their console colors,
and articles from 2011. Shit, that’s a bust as well.</p>

<p>If we take all of the Front-Enders, the UX experts, and the general Web Designer,
these people have a collection of their work that they dub “a portfolio”. Since,
Github is too convoluted of a profile, how do we as developers build a portfolio
like product? My solution was to build an app that is inherently simple, however;
shows off what I could do within the framework/language.</p>

<p>The result of my toils? <a href="https://github.com/bradendouglass/rails_presentation">This</a>. The application is a cross between Rails and
BackboneJs. Instead of using GIT as a log of items, I opted to throw mine into
a running “thought log” in the readme. The result isn’t something that resembles a traditional
portfolio, yet it requires less code reading and easily shows off the way the
I breaks down problems during the build process. For the Prag Prog lovers out there,
this could not be considered a “toy app” due to the infrequency of updates that
it will accrue. In addition, mine will likely never see production.</p>

<p>It is far from perfect; however, embodies a very clear function and process. Without further
ado… BOOM!</p>

      <a href="//2013/01/04/The-Old-Guard/">
        The Old Guard
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2013</span>

    <p>Do you happen to listen to these things called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast">smodcasts</a>? If you don’t,
than there is a good chance you missed <a href="http://5by5.tv/webahead/45">this episode of the Web Ahead</a>.
<a href="https://twitter.com/Malarkey">Andy Clark</a> had a solid rant concerning the Old VS New guard of the web.
Another person who feels relatively passionate towards this subject would be
<a href="http://www.drewwilson.com/">Drew Wilson</a> who puts on <a href="http://valiocon.com/">Valio Con</a>, which aims at bringing “young guns”
into the speaking spotlight.</p>

<p>Does anyone remember when Coda and Textmate were new on the scene? When I see
people continuing to use these tools I make a concoious effort to interrupt their
<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50730705aac422613b000001/big">workflow</a> and ask them what they are working on in <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffeescript</a>? Or
better yet: how they enjoy Compass? Sure this could be construed as a “dick”
approach however, you learn a lot about people while being said: dick. In 99%
of these mentioned interactions I am gifted with a face that expresses both
confusion and an utter sense of <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big">discomfort</a>.</p>

<p>If you were to prod deeper into what these “Web Professionals” do, you realize
that whatever it is, it has no outside influence. They don’t spend Saturdays
flipping through specs or reading other people’s code on Github. Rather, they
go to work and do the same thing they did yesterday; only changing when a client
shows or better yet, demmands something new. This reactive form of learning
is what separrates the Old from the New.</p>

<p>An example: <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/22/talks-to-help-you-become-a-better-front-end-engineer-in-2013/">Smashing Magazine wrote a recent article</a> about how to do just
this: “stay up to date.”</p>

<p>If you as a “Web Professional” think it is hard, than
yes, it is. Why? Well, the fact is that you have been resting on HTML and jQuery
for too damn long. It is time to wake the fuck up, smell the Coffeescript and
learn all the cool things that ‘the kids are doing.’ Why? The simple answer is
that you have already coded yourself out of a job. If you want to keep learning,
that job will likely still be there. However, if you continue to be a curmudgeon
about the whole subject, than you just might be… Properly Fucked.</p>

<p>With all good posts, this shall end with an epic list. The list will be broken
up by headlines describing the following projects. Find one that looks cool and
give it a whirl. Hate it? Drop and try something else.</p>
