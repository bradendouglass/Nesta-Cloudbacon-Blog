    <p>I have often felt bad about the fact that <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/528bbed3aac422ce02000015/big">this blrrg</a> <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2011-12-19-People-Can-Not-Read">highlights</a> the shortcommings of many of its’ <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big">own readers</a>. Manily that most of them are illiterate. To clarify and clear the air, I believe many of these people dont know how to read vs can’t read. Making jokes about people who can’t read is rather bougie and <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/528bbed3aac422ce02000015/big">this blrrg</a> will have none of that.</p>

        Pencils, Like Panthers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>Pencils are the panthers of the creative world (that’s right, I said it). They silently lay there until something brilliant passes by. They are often overlooked for their ink staining brethren and even subject to extreme prejudice through insane feats of “<a href="http://www.pencilrevolution.com/2005/12/russian-space-pen/">over-engineering</a>.” However any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad)">sane man</a> would agree, that the pencil is one of the most most interesting avenues to pull the scribbles of creativity from your brain to paper. I have even <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2012-08-29-A-Programmer-Journal">mentioned them several times</a> here on this blrrg.</p>

<p>The problem inherent in pencils is that there are two damn many of them leading to a complete <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Pencils/ct/1319">paralysis of choice</a>. Do you pick up a simple number 2 wooden pencil, attempt to find an original Blackwing, or go fore a more complicated drafting pencil? After quite an exhaustive search for the perfect one, I have found myself with these three.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.projectno8.com/products/drafting-pencil-green?category=274">Furst 2.0MM Clutch Drafting Pencil</a>: This is hands down my favorite pencil and deserving of the first place on this list. It is well crafted, sturdy and can be disassembled, cleaned and reassembled with ease. Being a smaller pencil (half size) this isn’t a pencil for someone who has “manly hands.” However, paired with a <a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-Lead-Holder-Refill-2-mm-B-Pack-of-6/pd/1577">good B lead</a>, the results are impossible to get from any other pencil. With it’s weighted feel and smooth clutch action, this pencil is well worth the 10 dollars.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pentel.com/store/sharp-kerry-mechanical-pencil">.5 mm Pentel Kerry</a>: The Kerry was and is likely to ever be one of the most expensive pencils that I have ever purchased. However, it is often times difficult to find a mechanical pencil that doesn’t consistently stab the user while being toted around in their pocket. This pencil, paired with it’s great weight distribution and capped design, makes it the pencil that I carry with me whenever I leave the house. Since it also takes standard, .5 mm lead, the barrel can hold a good amount of the tiny slivers meaning that it is unlikely you will be left high and dry anytime soon.</li>
  <li><a href="http://fieldnotesbrand.com/shop/">Field Notes Pencil</a>: With my love for Field Notes, it should be  somewhat of a surprise that it took me as long as it did to warm up to these. Especially since, everyone gets one when they purchase a pack directly from Field Notes. These tend to compliment the mechanical Furst. When I need a whiff of real wood and the size of a real pencil, there is one of these within reach at all times.</li>
</ol>

<p>Remember: every good engineer has an unequivocal, perhaps even irrational love of their favorite pencil.</p>

<p>Oh, and <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/528bbed3aac422ce02000015/big">happy fucking 2014, hugs for everyone</a>. Do us a favour and update your copywright footers.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Dec 2013</span>

    <p>When you work in ecommerce, especially for a company that focuses on producing great ecommerce experiences, you <em>dream</em> of working with certain clients. Perhaps they offer items that you are emotionally attached to, or it’s their corporate outlook towards their brand, or perhaps they directly influenced your childhood. Regardless, you constantly critique what they currently offer and pine to open up the web inspector in an attempt to improve your experience. You hyopthesize changes to their checkout flow or even write better and more convincing abandoned cart emails.</p>

<p>For me in 2014, this “dream client” would be <a href="http://www.filson.com/">Filson</a>. Sure I grew up in L.L.Bean’s back door but, Filson’s collection built from tin cloth, wool, and leather materials in combination with their old school, rustic charm make it one of the finest outdoor clothing manufactures. Here’s to hoping.</p>

        Staging Your Personal SS
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Nov 2013</span>

    <p>So much has happened since August and now. It is so actually incomprehensible
that I will leave my readership, what’s left of it to only wonder. Perhaps the
absence has actually ran all the readers, who in fact can’t read off and some
qualtity ones have returned. Alas, it is doubtful since the state of boredom
in America is <a href="http://m.us.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304243904579200142398477748">staggering these days</a>. Yep, we are so tired of stairing at our iPads we have resorted
to writing articles on chewing food. Sorry if the following doesn’t trump that.</p>

<p>Recently I have been thinking considerably about the need, and use of staging
branches. No, not servers, just the branches. Often times mine is in a state
of <code>reset --hard</code> disaray. The reflog reflects the final 100 pages in Umberto’s
freebasing masterpiece <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Island-Day-Before-Umberto/dp/0156030373/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1385003384&amp;sr=8-14&amp;keywords=umberto+eco">The Island Of The Day Before</a> (there is a good reason
why the audio cassette can be picked up for 1 cent). To top it all off? This
branch rarely-if-ever gets synced with GitHub.</p>

<p>This is where many purest string me up and make finely cured meat out of me.
Moreover, myself 1-2 years ago would have been right with them. However, now I simply
see no point in it. Staging is as tumultuous as this <a href="http://vimeo.com/78124534">video</a> or at best, the way
<a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/722.html">Douglass Adams describes the meaning of ‘life’</a>. Staging, an active staging, is in
constant flux, never complete, always on the move. Due to all of this, keeping it
in sync seems like a foolish persuit. Maybe I am missing something? If so shoot me
a message <a href="http://www.twitter.com/braidn">on Twitter</a> and make sure it is full of witty expletives.</p>

<p>Also on a much bigger note, watch out for other, somewhat better written (I think
there might even be editors involved) articles over at <a href="http://dynalog.tumblr.com/">Dynamo’s new bluurrrg</a>.
It’s guarenteed to be <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502bb36faac4221844000002/big">600%</a> better than this has ever been… Even when
this place was owned by the Swedish Anti-Powerpoint party.</p>

    <p>Having had the pleasure to get back into Ruby and subsequently the “Rails Stack”,
I am now writing a lot more tests. For many people this tends to be a bad thing
but, I find it one of the best ways to write any type of software. In addition,
you sometimes need to explain to a designer why a specific interaction needs to
occur. These guys/gals usually have a “cool story bro” mentality about them and since they
are often awash with color palettes, they sometimes “gloss” over specifics.</p>

<p>This will be a series of <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html">features</a> that are used to explain interactions in
my current work. Ready? Set-GO!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Say I am like: oh, crap, I forgot my oldest kid. Mostly because they are rambunctious and
spend a lot of money but, mainly because they were a mistake. Regardless, I sign back
into the application to add him but, because I am on my 4th Ardbeg Old Fashion of the
night (the kids drove me to this) I am all shaky and mistype my password.</p>

<p>I call it starry, forgotten night.</p>
