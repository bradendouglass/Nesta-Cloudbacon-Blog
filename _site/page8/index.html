    <p>Alright folks if you don’t use <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux">Tmux</a> you are pretty much doing it 100% wrong
and you won’t get much out of this post. Also, I understand… or “<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big">hear</a>” that
Screen is <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big">wicked awesome-tastic</a>; however, <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=I+could+give+two+shits">I couldn’t</a> care less.</p>

<p>If for by some miracle, you do use Tmux, why aren’t you using <a href="https://github.com/erikw/tmux-powerline">this</a>? Sure,
it is a little colorful, and a bit noisy… but, yeah feel free to tell your
friends you found it, and you didn’t hear it from me. Right, since most of the
segments are just bash scripts I have been searching for one that will show off
the current temp of the machine. What joy I must have been in when I found <a href="https://coderwall.com/p/cmw1mq">this
snippet from Coderwall</a>. Although, it is wrong.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big">wicked surprised</a> as well. Besides, does “Coderwall”
sound like a place where people go to circlejerk to anyone else… wait, is it?</p>

<p>It appears that between that…“Coderwall” and now, Tmux-powerline has gone
through a rewrite and yielded the snippet useless. Since there is a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">real place
for these kinds of things</a>, here is the <a href="https://gist.github.com/4404483">correct code in the form of a gist</a>.
Place the code into a newly written file in the segments directory and name it
something smart(with a <code>.sh</code> file extension). Then, run <code>chmod a+x filename</code> to
make the script <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50b6270eaac4228f36000009/big">super executable</a>. Finally, add it into your theme and</p>

<p>BOOM!</p>

<p>The only problem is smcFanControl in the menu bar and in Tmux both use the same
binary to read the temp. However, on my Macbook Air there is a 5-10 degree
differance between the two. Must be due to the fact that the temp is in <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big">Celcius</a>.</p>

    <p>That’s right bitches! We are done <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f46faac422800200001a/big">here</a>. 2012 is all but a bunch of history,
something that we will remember in the <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">rear view mirror</a>. On a side note,
I would hope that some of those plays are due to my incessant linking to it.
To be fair though, it is pretty fucking epic. Anyway, if you aren’t listening
to a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=metric+shit+ton">metric-shit-ton</a> of <a href="http://rd.io/x/QVoeADMzpQ">this</a>, you hate <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5045518529ca15f836000020/big">this</a></p>

<p>In addition, <a href="http://youtu.be/4LJw6PAi5Q8">hat tip</a>, the metric system is “<strong>badass</strong>”</p>

<p>So what would a top ten of this year look like? Glad you asked. Without further
ado, keep it <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big">real</a> for the rest of the year, be prepared for the 13, and
enjoy the list.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/whats-new/">OSX</a>: Yes, perhaps I am a self proclaimed Apple lover but, it is hard to
argue with the fit and finish of BSD, Linux, and Unix that Apple has accomplished
with their recent OS release. Kudos and if you have an issue with “planned
obsolescence”, feel free to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface">buy one of these</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://robbwolf.com/what-is-the-paleo-diet/">Paleo living</a>: I have spent a good part of the year following a rigorous
Paleo diet and am convinced that we are brainwashed by bread and McDonalds.
I have never felt better, stronger, etc. The food might seem a little weird
(beef heart) but, it is well worth the experience/experiment.</li>
  <li><a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50b6270eaac4228f36000009/big">Quiting</a>: Not something that everyone should look to do. However, if you
are feeling stuck, now, rather than later is the best time to quit. Do something
fresh, exciting, scary, whatever!</li>
  <li>Podcasts: This one seems to slip into every top 10 list since 2009, when I started
podcasting. If you yearn (in your pants yabbies) to learn, than it it hard not to glean
something from listening. Here are a few current ones from a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ow7dlm20y6qbpba/Subscriptions-bPhone.opml">recent Instacast dump</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.rdio.com/">Rdio</a>: Hot on the list of audible items, Rdio and it’s stylish design
wax the music nerd in me. Having a plethora of mp3s on my computer doesn’t make
much sense when you can stream an unlimited amount of anything.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/">Apartment Therapy</a>: My wife and myself recently moved into our first
apartment where we didn’t share space with friends or a roommate. After living
for so long with people, you shed most of your unneeded belongings. This means
that we had a lot of shopping to do and much of it inspired from this blog.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">Apple’s New iMac</a>: Being a laptop man, I rarely look towards Apple’s
desktop offerings. However, this has changed with their recent upgrade. I have
spent a few minutes with the 27inch model and the take away is: the Fusion drive
seems brilliant and overall the machine is a beast of power and beauty.</li>
  <li>Surgery. If you are an athlete and you are sitting on a past injury…and you
have health insurance, you are a moron. I have been nursing a failing shoulder for
nearly 10 years. This year I gave up and had surgery and I will never look back.</li>
  <li>Trivia: wading into the trivia waters can be a shark filled affair. There are
some players out there that are unbelievable with the knowledge they have access to
at the tip of their subconscious. I gave it a whirl and although, our team has yet
to become spectacular, we have learned a lot. Moral? Do something you suck at and
keep doing it even if you never get better.</li>
  <li>Javascript: Javascript was my <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">language of the year</a>. In addition, I learned
Coffeescript, a little bit of Node, and a bunch of other random stuff. I am still
no where near as efficient in it as I am Ruby; however, there is a spot in my heart
for this unruly little functional language.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yep, that’s all she wrote.</p>

        Boredom To Getting Something Done
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Dec 2012</span>

    <p>Posts have been a little sparse lately due to me moving to a new job and needing
to learn how to ‘do’ <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50b6270eaac4228f36000009/big">PHP</a> again. However, there has been a few instances where
I have found myself completely bored. To fight the need to tool around on <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/4f65e376300aaa98270000b8/big">hacker news</a>
in these situations, I give you <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big">this</a></p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Oops, I actually meant <a href="http://bc5e368a8867af61c3ed-e931c6f21220c188f04654bd7a220e82.r14.cf2.rackcdn.com/omnifocus_blog.png">this</a>. It might be a little hard to ‘grep’ what’s
going on in the picture but here is the idea. Whatever system you use to keep yourself
in-check and productive, probably utilizes tags or ‘contexts’ for the true <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355686690&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gtd">GTDers</a>.
Create a tag that is as simple as ‘Web’. The next part is hard but, with some simple
conditioning, success isn’t far.</p>

<p>Start training yourself to look back at this context every time you find yourself
bored on the Internet. When you feel that nagging need to navigate to Facebook, Pinterest, or Pandora, stop.
Think about what you are doing, then click on your <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">productivity suite</a> of choice
and see what you <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big">really could be doing</a>.</p>

<p>This method hinges on a couple of things that are rather ‘long tail’ if an <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wilt">Internet
consumption addiction</a> has already taken root. The biggest and by far the hardest
is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/1400069289/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355687216&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=habits">developing the habit</a> to look back at your todo-list every time you find your
focus wavering. However, if mastered, the things that might get finally finished
will astonish everyone. Give it a whirl and <a href="https://twitter.com/braidn">hit me up on twitter</a> with the results!</p>

    <p>Disclaimer: this tip centers around the use of <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> but, doesn’t
require the premium “Power Pack”. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> is…or should be a go-to for
anyone doing any level of front-end development. It is an indispensible
knowledge base on anything concerning HTML, CSS, or Js. Since Alfred has
a great way to add custom searches, we can pipe items into Alfred and
have it pass the search onto MDN.</p>

<p>The string to get this started is:</p>

<p><code>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q={query}</code></p>

<p>MDN also encodes spaces as <code>+</code> symbols so one will have to check the
appropriate box within the Alfred Custom Search settings.</p>

<p>Now, if you have a question about how <code>line-height</code> works you can simply
type <code>mdn line-height</code> and <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big"><strong>BOOM</strong></a>, stupendous success.</p>

    <p>I had the chance to sit down and talk with a fairly awesome individual
this morning. This, if you don’t know is somewhat of a rarety. However, one of the
best parts of the conversation revolved around one of <a href="http://nickshell1983.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/rubix-cube.jpg">these things
thing</a>. He passed it to me and told me to get just one side. The
result? <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50730705aac422613b000001/big">This</a>. Needless to say I bought one on the way home.</p>
