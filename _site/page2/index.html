Take a listen and learn a little bit about the person behind this shit show of a blog.

        Slack ZNC and IRC Meet For A Shootoff
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Nov 2014</span>

    <p>Feel free to raise your hand every time you log into the web interface for Slack (you know, the messaging app <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-raises-120-million-2014-10">everyone is flinging money at</a>, seriously does anyone remember <a href="http://www.glitchthegame.com/">Glitch</a>?) and are automagically angered by the battering of annoyances that surround “Notifications.” Yes, notifications, those pesky little fuckers that <a href="http://onlineslangdictionary.com/meaning-definition-of/kife">kife</a> your time and feed that growing portion of lizard brain.</p>

<p>Slack is great for team communications however, can easily become a bear to manage, even through their plethora of keyboard shortcuts. If you, like myself love the team I work for but, don’t want to just shut them out for a large amount of the day, what are the options? Glad you didn’t ask.</p>

<p>For the last three weeks… or so. What day of June is it? I have been using, chatting, consuming Slack through its’ IRC Gateway. As it happens, I mentioned the word IRC to a fellow developer yesterday and he was surprised it was still around. Yes, yes IRC is still around and for many of us in the programming community, it is the defacto way to communicate with our peers. However, there is one problem with IRC that has plagued it for quite some time. When you aren’t logged in you miss all of the juicy cat gifs everyone is sharing.</p>

<p>A great solution for this came about several years ago (it’s still 2005 right?) called <a href="http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a>. ZNC is a bouncer that sits around in all of your connected IRC rooms and servers (Slack included) and captures what everyone is saying. Once you connect back to ZNC with a client like the newly and brilliantly updated <a href="http://www.codeux.com/textual/">Textual 5</a>, ZNC will read back to you what you missed and when it was typed. Pretty fucking sweet! So how do we tie all of this together?</p>

<p>First thing is first we are assuming that ZNC is all set up and an Admin user is available. If this hasn’t occurred yet, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-znc-an-irc-bouncer-on-an-ubuntu-vps">this guide does a wonderful job</a>. I recommend creating a new user for each Slack gateway (an admin might have to activate this if you are just a mere peon). In addition, you will want to keep your nick as the user outlined in your Slack’s gateway settings and your bind-host to: 0.0.0.0. The bind-host thing is odd, it’s Slack being persnickety, just need to deal.</p>

<p>Now that we have a login for ZNC, we need to add a server to this user. The easiest way to do this is to add a server to Textual5, and login using the <strong>ZNC</strong> credentials for your Slack user. Once signed in, you won’t be connected to Slack however, you should msg help to /*status for a list of commands. One of these commands will be for adding a server which takes 3 arguments:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The url of the Slack gateway. Again, this is found on the specific gateway settings page for each organization.</li>
  <li>The port, which in this case is 6667</li>
  <li>A password which is your specific Slack IRC password. This is different than the normal Slack password. Again, grab this from your gateway specific settings page on Slack.</li>
</ol>

<p>All connections to Slack servers should be done so over a secure or SSL connection (why won’t you think of the children). When adding the server, make certain to add a plus sign(<code>+</code>) immediately before the port (no spaces). Simply disconnect and reconnect to the ZNC server and BOOM! All of your rooms will show up as well as any private rooms that you are apart of.</p>

<p>If you have logged off for a while or over night, the moment you log back in, ZNC will read back what you missed. Success! Slack integrations also show up in rooms as well! This is is a double success if a team relies on GitHub commits or their CI status. Overall I like being able to choose my own consumption point for Slack. It frees me up to control the notifications in a way that works for me… without annoying me insensately. For the mobile experience, I recommend a combination of email alerts for missed mentions, ZNC and <a href="http://palaverapp.com/">Palaver</a>(there may be some marvelous IRC app for Android out there… nah, I doubt it).</p>

<p>If one of these points doesn’t seem to work for you or you get stuck feel free to reach out to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/braidn">me on Twitter</a> and we can get it fixed ASAP.</p>

        Prose.io Tweaks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2014</span>

    <p><a href="http://prose.io/#about">Prose.io</a> is one of the best ways to interact with markdown-style form blog content. It has allowing me to write on the web, commit to GitHub and have cloudbacon run its tests ( yes it is a blog but, yes I am a programmer so most of my shit has tests ), and auto deploy to Heroku. Recently however, I have wanted to streamline this process.</p>

<p>Prose gives you the ability to define specific metadata attributes that are editable in the sidebar. In addition, and really what I was looking for, it gives the user the ability to only allow one directory to be editable. This is awesome because it shows the user this very directory instead of forcing them to dig their way into a directory hierarchy to find their blog content.</p>

<p>Without further ado: the following <a href="https://gist.github.com/braidn/f82fd63ac00955eeaeb3">gist</a> is what cloudbacon is rocking. Pay special attention to the naming of the file if you don’t use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> ( the underscore is required ).</p>

        Compilation Starts With A 'C'
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>Yeah, this might be a rather simple statement, mainly because the word Compilation really truly starts with the letter: ‘c’. However, the idea also extends to the C language.  Anytime a C program is built and sent off to its consumers there is a semi-complicated, definitely fiddly make/build process. This is what defines a compiled language like C or <a href="https://golang.org/">Golang</a> from there interpreted brethren. An example of some interpreted languages would be the following: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="http://groups.engin.umd.umich.edu/CIS/course.des/cis400/forth/forth.html">Forth</a>. Is there an actual Forth “official” website? If for some reason you are human, and don’t quite “grok” what Forth is, <a href="http://cstruter.com/articles/article/1/4">this is a pretty good explanation</a>.</p>

<p>So why on earth is this worth another blog post? There exists an awash of blog posts, Quora answers and miles of Wikipedia edits concerning these topics. Glad you asked. All of this hoopla can be summed up in this one <a href="http://harpjs.com/">exciting NPM module called Harp</a>. Harp, if you read their website, is an exciting <a href="https://gist.github.com/davatron5000/2254924">static site blogging tool</a> that will save you all the trouble of running one of those WordPress things. Which, if you read and listen to much of the Internet (no worries, it is chill you <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2011-12-19-People-Can-Not-Read">likely choose not to read</a>), is like running a third world country.</p>

<p>This Harp thing… It looks pretty sweet, it even runs on Javascript which is not named even after a language that isn’t compiled. However, if one were to scroll 7/12ths down the page (yes we are succinct here), it would appear that this is “compiled”. Compiled you might ask (if you chose to read). That seems weird, why would we need to compile things like HTML/CSS when the last time anyone checked, these things could be considered ‘web native’.</p>

<p>Any rational person at this point would be all like: WTF? <a href="http://i.imgur.com/FHWMO.gif">Node Javascript</a> is like a whole server? Eh? There are even frameworks that rhyme with Rails that work on this very same platform. So why would we have to compile our static files, or site, or whatever when this can be done directly on the server? Oh, because you need to compile locally and then commit your compiled code (because that makes sense). Unless of course you just wanted to take the folder that is generated by this compilation and FTP (sorry SFTP) it to your server. All of this makes sense in 2002 but, rarely could be considered a standard in 2014.</p>

<p>Could this get any better you maybe asking? Well you could write all of your HTML in smaller, completely unmanageable chunks because only 50 out of every 328 web developers understands <a href="http://jade-lang.com/">Jade</a> enough to juggle where they are currently in that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">pipe</a> field of hell.. But, no worries, Jade is way less fiddly because you don’t have all of those brackets (shit, that’s why I love HAML and SLIM because writing inline tags is a breeze and expected output is at an all time high). Except, when you want to include someone in the project who has no idea about Jade and tries to modify the compiled source because it just makes sense… to every web developer. Then we have trouble. Though now, how do you compile the compiled source? Yeah I don’t know either. Presumably, and this is almost always a likely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Because I am not smart enough.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so there are quite a few glaring issues with compiling things when the runtime is actually a perfectly good server. However, there must be some reasons for these kind of static site generators? Sure! Pet projects, quick one offs, LaunchRock style landing pages and personal blogs are perfect use cases. However, due to the technical knowledge required for bringing new team members up to speed, their reliance on committing compiled code to the VCS repository, and their somewhat beta 0.0.1-ness these should remain within the personal realm. Also, having to wait for someone to return from <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/504f465629ca15bb4b000000/big">their lunch break</a> just to get something compiled must be a boon for the entire teams velocity.</p>

<p>Yes, <a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-october-6">this</a></p>

        Goodbye Bloated Fellow
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Aug 2014</span>

    <p><a href="https://www.everlane.com/">Monkey patching</a> has been a common thing in all Ruby libraries over the years. One of the largest of them being Rspec. We all know, and love Rspec, unless of course you are a member of the Rails Core Team. Yet, with the recent release of Rspec and its’ 17 gems Rspec has given me a bad funk, that I just can’t seem to dispel. Recently, I had the chance to create a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">SPA</a> and decided to throw Rspec out in favor of Minitest. Especially the following gem:</p>

<p><a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/minitest-rails">minitest-rails</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/blowmage">Mike Moore</a></p>

<p>Due to the diminutive, and quick nature of the “application”, my current usage of Minitest has been slim. However, it was just installed in a new side project and hopefully I will be able to integrate it with any new or upcoming projects. It’s small, fun, and fast. Sure I introduce several other gems that add an element of monkey patching to the equation. Although, over-all I don’t miss anything about Rspec’s seeming bloat.</p>

<p>So with a whiff of arrogance, and smattering of bias go forth and give it a whirl. Oh! And here are some sensible defaults that I feel make the transition process a little more upbeat. Also you can find the <a href="https://gist.github.com/braidn/b713c87758b3d62c4002">public gist of this jazz here</a></p>
