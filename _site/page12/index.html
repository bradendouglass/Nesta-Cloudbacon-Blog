    <p>When it comes to self improvement, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346026480&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=apprenticeship+patterns">improvement overall</a>, one of
the hardest things to do is admit that <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big">you might not know
something</a>. Most of the time we couldn’t even list, in any order, the
things that “we don’t know.” Not one. <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340aa129ca15433d000010/big">Suriously</a>, try really hard
and use <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/503abec229ca15f37500000d/big">your power’s of awesome</a> to <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/about">get a hold</a> of me. For
myself? The hardest part of my software life, and therefore the thing I
have the least amount of experience with is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship">Mentorship</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The experience of having a master to work under and to pester with
questions is invaluable when it comes to walking the road from
an apprentice to a master. There are a few methods (IRC, message boards,
etc) that are acceptable if direct mentorship is not available. However,
these substitutes should not be used without looking for the real deal.</p>

<p>So without further ado, and let’s be honest, it is a Sunday, here are
some cool ways to get hooked up with some web programmery based mentors.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.apprentice.io/">Apprentice.io</a>: a Boston based awesome sauce Ruby shop named
ThoughtBot have a really great thing going on. If you live in the
North-East or are mobile, this is one of the best programs to check
out.</li>
  <li><a href="http://hashrocket.com/people/work-at-hashrocket/apprentice">HashRocket</a>: Another East coast Ruby company that has a lot of
cool people behind it. Pretty much the ThoughtBot of Florida.</li>
  <li><a href="http://hungryacademy.com/">Hungry Academy</a>: A devision of the folks at Living Social out of
DC. The program has only had one run but, they hired 100% of the
developers who went through it.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.codeacademy.org/">Code Academy</a>: Chicago based program that focuses on the web
over specifically Ruby and Rails.</li>
  <li><a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DevBootcamp</a>: This program costs quite a lot at 11,200 but there
have been some rumblings about the first class seeing salaries hit
80k</li>
</ol>

<p>BOOM!</p>

        The Cheapest Of All

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>I happened across <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/08/cars-not-for-us-the-cheapest-generation-explains-the-freedom-of-not-owning/261516/">this article</a> this week and was rather
unastonished to hear that <a href="http://mobilize.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/millennials-30-up.jpg">we</a> are the cheapest generation ever.
Since many of my readers <a href="http://cloudbacon.com/2011-12-19-People-Can-Not-Read">can’t actually read</a> here is a quick
one-over.</p>

<p>Apparently the Millenials aren’t doing the <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">same shit</a> in the <a href="http://tweedrun.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/PennyFarthing.jpg">same
way</a> as our parents. Oh, and this is bad btw, if you couldn’t infer
it. We are waiting until we hit <a href="http://www.psmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mmw-competitive-112911.jpg">middle age</a> to think about new cars or
our first house. In addition, this kind of “<a href="http://sundial.csun.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/SO18-Tea-610x462.jpg">fiscal responsibility</a>”
is tanking the <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big">great state of USA</a> and pushing it into the path of <a href="http://blog.craftzine.com/Death_Star_watermelon.jpg">this</a>.</p>

<p>My response to 99% of this article and <a href="http://experification.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/life2.jpg">75% of 100% of life</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bullshit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For starters, the “Global Stragegic Marketing” dude from GM in the <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">Atlantic</a> article
is <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big">tripping balls</a>. You are 31, which means that you are only 4 or
so years away from being one yourself. Does this mean you don’t know who
you are? Likely. The rest of the article and the concept are right on,
along with some of the responses that have cropped up over the past few
days.</p>

<p>We don’t care, as a group of people, to be overly encumbered with
things. This doesn’t make us <a href="http://grist.org/list/2012-01-04-this-guy-only-owns-15-things/">this asshat</a>. But, it does make us
conscious of every purchase we make. It has nothing to do with the
instability of our jobs(which definitely exists), or the lack of jobs in
general. It all boils down to one word: Freedom. Does your product get
us a little closer to attaining it? No? Well fuck off(said by a
generation of people with their wallets closed and their minds <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photo/_new/080730-ped-texting-vmed-12p.380%3B380%3B7%3B70%3B0.jpg">sudo</a> open).</p>

    <p>Starting a blog post with a story or a list is automatic <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big">link love</a>
from the <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?t=">Googs</a>…I think.</p>

<h3 id="a-story">A Story</h3>

<p>I happen to work for a really wonderful company that makes a good amount
of its profits from public transport. <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502bb36faac4221844000002/big">Planes, trains, buses</a>, you name
it. Just not <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big">automobiles</a>. If you were to work at a place like this
and take pride in your product, you would likely ride the bus. Studying
every move people make, what defines their buying decisions. Moreover, even down
to what type of music they listen to as their public transport trudges
on…<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340ae129ca15593d000005/big">consuming more of their day than their feedumb cars</a>.</p>

<p>Your participation / <a href="http://cageme.herokuapp.com/random">devotion</a> would lead you to purchasing the
product that you produced and believing the fact that someday, just
maybe, you could sell your car in favor of supporting the people that
make your life possible. I work to support public transport, and these
feelings <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50368ee329ca154c66000002/big">wash over me</a> on a daily basis.</p>

<h3 id="the-deal">The Deal</h3>

<p>If you produce a product and you can’t stand behind it by actually using
it, you have <a href="http://smallbiztrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/business-punch.jpg">no business being in business</a>. What you are really in
it for is the money, and as we can see in our current economy, this
method doesn’t lead to sustainability. Today is Friday…I think. Take
the weekend to look over your current product and how you feel about it.
Are you passionate? If not, take Monday and Tuesday of next week to
reflect on the whole ordeal. If things look bleak by Wednesday, quit.</p>

<p>Suriosly.</p>

    <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>There are a lot of good ones out there at the moment, so without further
ado, here is your <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50305c7729ca153546000001/big">list</a></p>

<h3 id="incumbents">Incumbents</h3>

<p>The two that come to mind in this category are <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">Things</a> and
<a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/">OmniFocus</a>. Both have iPhone and accompanying Mac apps and both
sync seamlessly between the two platforms. Things lacked this functionality in the
past but, it has recently been updated. Full disclosure, I am a
super-fan of OmniFocus and I also feel anything designed and or nudged
by <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda">Merlin Mann</a> and <a href="http://ethan.schoonover.usesthis.com/">Ethan Schoonover</a> is worth checking out /
using until they make something new.</p>

<p>Regardless of bias, both of these applications will work well for your
daily to-do’s, with OmniFocus being much more tailored to the <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">GTD</a>
methodology.</p>

<h3 id="fo-freeze">FO Freeze</h3>

<p>The two that we will talk about (there are quite a few in this category)
are the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/features.html#reminders">Apple Reminders app</a> and <a href="http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/">Wunderlist</a>. Both of these apps
will set you back a grand total of 0 <a href="http://www.bluebison.net/sketchbook/2008/0108/kiwi-small.png">Yankee Dollar-y-Doos</a> and both
will sync between your Apple powered devices. Wunderlist will even work
in a browser, Windows, and Linux. Both of these are more traditional
list managers and have fewer (read: <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/503258b5aac422d76f000036/big">less complex</a>) frivolous
features.</p>

<p>If you are in the market for a sleek, simple, and free app, take a
<a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5032f2bf29ca153c71000025/big">stroll</a> and give one of these a whirl.</p>

<h3 id="webby">Webby</h3>

<p>The three we will go over briefly (because really to get an idea of how
they work, you should be trying them out) are <a href="http://asana.com/">Asana</a>,
<a href="https://cheddarapp.com/">Chedder</a>, and <a href="http://www.getflow.com/">Flow</a>. These applications aren’t <em>only</em> for the
web, all three of them have a mobile component, and Chedder even has an
early stage Mac client. Chedder is a really simple and fast set of lists
where Flow attempts to recreate the Things experience (half-hearted GTD)
on the web and Asana is great for working with teams.</p>

<h3 id="fin">Fin</h3>

<p>There is a really quick, and dirty rundown of the current crop of <a href="http://gadgetsdna.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/SystemPanel-fo-Android-3-280x500.png">task
managers</a>. My recommendations? Give each one a whirl and see what
fits your lifestyle. Some of us have complex, “big boy” needs, while
others benefit from a simple list manager.</p>

      <a href="//2012/08/22/Think-In-Markup/">
        Thinking in Markup
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Yep, so wait. What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">Markup</a>? Well if you happen to follow the
links on this blog (and you really are safer if you don’t), Wikipedia
catagorizes…or lists it into 3 distinct groups:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Presentational Markup</strong>: Which happens to be the <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">XML</a>-y type
stuff that <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">Word</a> and other word processors use. In addition, this
style of markup is seldomly seen by the end user.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedural Markup</strong>: What we will be focusing on. This style of
markup IS seen by the user and is <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/502ea8eaaac4223116000014/big">sprinkled</a>(be ware the Wizard) throughout the text.
A preprocessor comes along, reads the text and hands the styled text
back to the user.</li>
  <li><strong>Descriptive Markup</strong>: This form is sprinkled throughout the text,
much like the Procedural form; however, it has no bearing on a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor">preprocessor</a>. A good example of this is the hashtag(#tag) syntax
that <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/50340aa129ca15433d000010/big">some of us</a> use on <strike>Twitter</strike> AppDotNet to
catagorize our updates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, until <a href="https://twitter.com/daltonc">Dalton</a> comes to his senses and realizes that he has a cool
project with a dumb name, <a href="https://join.app.net/">it</a> will be written that way.</p>

<p>What we are talking about here is a light language (sometimes called “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Specific-Languages-Addison-Wesley-Signature-Series/dp/0321712943?tag=duckduckgo-d-20">DSLs</a>”)
that is used to express oneself beyond text. Anyone not see the beauty
in that? The user gets a <a href="https://gimmebar.com/view/5031916aaac422225b000016/big">free ride</a> by using text documents that are
generated with style, flare and that never expire (text documents <a href="http://textfiles.com/">wont
be going out of style anytime soon</a>).</p>

<p>Many of us, myself included have flocked to the <a href="http://images.macworld.com/images/opinion/graphics/151235-gruber-small_original.jpg">lovable</a>
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. Originally it was used to style documents for web
viewing; however, now it has bleed into many text editors, iPhone and
Android editors, and it is still fairly prevalent when it comes to web
based writing. I have become so accustomed to the syntax, and
incorporated its usage into so many applications that my brain now
thinks on Markdown.</p>

<p>What Markup language do you think in?</p>
