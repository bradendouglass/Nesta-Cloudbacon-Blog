    <span class="post-date">14 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>This week on <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/42">Hypercritical</a> (a web show
hosted by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/siracusa">Jon Siracusa</a> and aired on the <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5
podcasting network</a>), Jon talks at length about the
“shodd-i-ness” behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-ebook/dp/B004W2UBYW/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321327391&amp;sr=1-1">Steve’s new
biography</a>.
The real issue seems to stem from Isaacson’s lack of domain specific knowledge
and unwillingness to learn.</p>

<p>This idea is something that has been on my mind as of late. Who brings in a
team of individuals to accomplish a task who have zero experience? Would you
turn to a marketer who writes copy all day to solve a UX problem? Unless the
individual has domain specific knowledge of the subject, or they are willing to
learn, they don’t belong in the room, conversation or the decision process.</p>

<p>It is just sad that Isaacson didn’t do Steve the justice he deserved. The
episode is well worth the hour and 20 minutes of your time.</p>

        Git Powered Blog Drafts
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>Ok, I don’t personally care how you build/host/hump your blog, although in
general, it is probably, wait…for it <a href="http://wordpress.com/">wrong</a>. Now that we got that
out of the way, here is a nifty idea to think about:</p>

<p>Use the simplistic yet elegant power behind <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> to keep a robust and
burgeoning amount of blog posts and drafts. Why? Well Git is able to track
changes across a system fairly well..shit it’s actually the only thing it does.
Being able to track diffrent blog posts, when they were completed and being
able to rewind to them, seems like something a powerful blogger might like to
have at his or her fingertips. To get going you need 2 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, the powerful (some would say the best…and or the “bomb”)
    <s>source</s>
    <p>version control management system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A static generated site. This means, that all of your files are flat in
  nature and rely on no database to produce the overall content. Not only does
  this solve a nasty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">injection</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JFfN5pKzFU">problem</a>, but it can
  withstand high amounts of traffic. Here are a <a href="http://mathematism.com/2010/12/22/static-site-generators/">few
  options</a>(mostly Python and Ruby variants) if you are completely
  lost to this concept. Don’t worry about choosing one that is “wrong”. Most
  of the posts can be moved from one system to another.</li>
</ol>

<p>Navigate to the root folder of your newly built static site blog and invoke:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2710866.js?file=git init"></script>

<p>This will create a brand spanking new git repo, surrounding your code in a
wonderous pillow of fluffy safety. From here it is really simple:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2710866.js?file=git branch"></script>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2710866.js?file=git checkout"></script>

<p>Now you are free to modify your new post to your hearts content. By using
“post” at the beginning of the branch name, it is easy to see what branches are
posts and what are other, structural changes. This concept is ridiculously easy
however, it works well for one reason: nil == friction. One of Git’s most
amazing features is its ability to handle branches and merging said branches
with ease. This “freedom” cuts down on the constant anxiety of “lost work”. If
you aren’t worried about losing work, causing problems, or breaking something
you are free to use 100% of your creative juices to…well create!</p>

<p>Elegant solutions will always trample their off-the-shelf, boxed, rural cousins.</p>

        Thoughts On Reason
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2011</span>

    <p>Most people with any type of BS or BA degree from a mid sized liberal arts
college, adore banging their own logic drum in some form or another. Often
considered logic’s dipolar brother: emotions are rebelious, temultuous and
overal something that many of us in the technical world strive to avoid.
Although the object in question might resemble a drum, what is actually being
played is something far more <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">phalic</a>.</p>

<p>Reason, in it’s simplest form, the one read from the dictionary, is the power
of the mind to think, understand and form a judgement. However, reason, in the
words of Raiden is akin to: “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJeQ6ZKPxyw">Finish
him</a>”! That’s right, it is what
occurs at the very end of a train, not at the beginning.</p>

<p>No one has ever entered a situation and through processing NOTHING, come up
with a sound and logical answer. Our brains, like computers are meant to
internalize, process, bias against and, eventually come up with something that
sounds “correct”. The idea of correctnesss will be taken with a grain of salt
for the remainder of this rant, it deserves its own post later down the road.</p>

<p>This idea is often tested in some control group, something that won’t harm or
potentially destroy the situation. Afterwards, and really only if a desired
outcome is apparent is the logical answer put forth into action. Logic…appears
to come very last. Except many of us fall into the trap of using it first.</p>

<p>Well wait? How is that possible? Real thinkers, Einstein, Tesla, Plato, you
name it used their observations and their peers to come to a solution. They
took the surrounding ideas, along with their own and mashed them together much
like today’s meemes. Their logic was a framework built from listening and
observing the masses. They didn’t claim to have every answer at their
fingertips (thank you Jimmy Whales), they relied on empirical studies.</p>

<p>What is seen today is a country full of people who are attempting to fill
everyone’s glass jars with their own version of untested logic. This is
<em>mind-bleeding</em>! Instead, why not sit back and make conscious attempts to learn
from each human interaction, every day.</p>

<p>Give it a whirl, you will be surprised how much you learn and how much humility
you exude.</p>

    <p>A great <a href="3">article</a> about the iminent decline of the sysadmin. It is exactly

        On Demanding Free Awesome-Software

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2011</span>

    <p>If…perhaps you had been sitting under a chair hiding from your
coffin-death-sled this week (Oct 3), the peeps behind the wonderful app
<a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> released their new itteration on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12">Mac App
Store</a>. If you happened
to click on the previous link, you would have realized that Growl has
transitioned itself from something free to something worth $1.99. With most
transitions of this manner, there has been a
<a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">metric-shit-ton</a> of user outcry.</p>

<p>Growl(an extremely short history) has been the defacto OS X(it does function on
windows), that’s “Macz” for all you <a href="http://youtu.be/migIVbzPW5U">nubs</a>,
notification software since August of 2004. Most people forget that the app was
a preference pane tucked away in system preferences. In many cases, Growl came
packaged with other applications that installed it to handle their own
notifications. Thereby relieving the user from ever having to worry about
whether it(Growl) was installed or not.</p>

<p>However, now we need to download it from the Mac App Store or MAS if you like
acronyms…and you need to PAY FOR IT! Holy SHIT, like for realz? Pay for it?
For all of you who feel like you are entitled to awesome software, and Growl
falls under this moniker, for free…you’re not. Not-Sorry.</p>

<p>These moochers are the same asshats who jailbreak their iPhones to simply
download apps without paying. Although, there are plenty of really great paid
apps on the <a href="http://youtu.be/migIVbzPW5U">Cydia</a> store. They spend hours of
their time searching for free versions of applications that cost them 2.99. The
real problem, before I go over the deep end, is: these developers are not
Adobe.</p>

<p>They are a small team of good friends who have banded together and spent a lot
of time, sweat, and tears to build something that they hope can turn into a
miniture business. They might have shitty jobs, hard families, or whatever but,
they are there to make an attempt at bettering their overall living situation.
You consistently stealing their apps isn’t assisting them in any way.</p>

<p>In addition, people should be pining to pay for this software, especially
Growl, because it truly is kick ass. It should be your honor and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri_(Japanese\)">giri</a> to pay for these great
products. The minimal payment helps feed the developers and allows them to
focus on the software that you have paid for and love.</p>

<p>Make a budget per week, pay for the software that you love, revel in the fact
that you have helped someone reach their dream and someone might reciprocate on
it when you near yours.</p>
