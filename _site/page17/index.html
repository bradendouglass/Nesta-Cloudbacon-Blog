    <span class="post-date">02 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>THROWDOWN! What the fuck am I thinking with all of this? Anyway some of the
readers might have seen a <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">influx</a> of posts in their feed with this blog
over the past couple of days. What is happening is a blog posting will be
performed each and every day for 30 whole days or 26 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time">metric days</a> (whichever way you swing).
I am sure I have tried this before but, I always seem to fall short on the 9th day.
Well folks, this time it is going to be different.</p>

<strike>Mission</strike>
<p>no, wait <strike>delegation</strike>…hmm.
Operation. No that’s all wrong.</p>

<p>Anyway, the idea will be to generate some sort of useful tidbit, hack,
Ruby code, workflow, piece of awesome, or something every day until
September 1st. All of the wacky linking will be provided free of charge. So make damn sure to
click as many links as possible in a futile attempt to figure out what
is going on in my rat trap of a brain.</p>

<p>The prize for all of this you might ask? <a href="http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&amp;pid=pdkb400bn">A Happy Hacking Keyboard Pro 2</a>.
Yes, I have been looking at picking one up for a long time and need a
chellenge of this proportion to offset the cost of that sexy, sexy
keyboard. Until tomorrow…also some general rules are below!</p>

<h2 id="day-challenge-rules">30 Day Challenge Rules</h2>

<ol>
  <li>There must be a post for every day in August no matter how many days
actually exist in the month</li>

    <p><strong>Story</strong>: My wife and I were cooking dinner one night (actually I had
returned from the gym and was generally being a nuisance) and a friend
asked to use the frying pan to cook his steak after we had finished. I
said that I had one more thing to cook and I would just throw the steak
on when I was done. At first he mulled this around in his head and then
gave me this response:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nah, I want to sear the steak really quickly and try and lock in
the…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pretty much gave up listening after that. The gist being that he had
devised a very elaborate plan to cook his steak. This is great, a young
man having an opinion and a plan on how he/she was going to cook their
dinner. Except for one very interesting thing: The meat was purchased at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_Lion">Food Lion</a>. If you weren’t in the know, Food Lion sells the
bottom-of-the-shit-barrel produce and meat. So what does all of this
equate to? You guessed it! Putting lipstick on a pig.</p>

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview">Microsoft</a> is doing this these days with the anoucement and
inevitable fail that is Windows 8. A mediocre product slabbed with a
coat of <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Paint-Your-Toe-Nails">coral paint</a> is still…wait for it: a FUCKING MEDIOCRE
product. As a <a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">reader</a> you can sub out the word ‘product’ with
people, pigs, jobs, or anything really. This all relates to one simple fact:
<em>no one</em> has ever won a race being mediocre.</p>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>So what did everyone do yesterday (4th of July) instead of blow shit up
and drink too much beer? Unfortunatly an hour of work turned into three
wrestling with <a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">Tmux</a>, specifically the way information is presented
on the <a href="http://c522735.r35.cf2.rackcdn.com/tmux4.jpg">lower bar</a>…or whatever it is called. Afterwards, I had a
conversation with my roommate concerning what we had done during the day
for “work.” When we concluded, he made a snippy joke about
“leaving me to my colored text.” For a second (just a hot one) I realized that he was perhaps
right in the sense that I was pissing my day away.</p>

<p>His comment, unlike normal,  stuck with me
through the rest of the day. Through fireworks, copious amounts of beer,
Crossfit chit chat, everything really. The thing is, when we are forced
to do work with tools <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/home">that we don’t enjoy</a>, our work begins to
reflect our <a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">attitude</a>. It seeps into every little nook and cranny and it
infects us. Often-times in ways that we could never begin to imagine.</p>

<p>To cope we turn to things that might infuse us with happiness. We look for solace in
Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and especially buying needless amounts of
shit. These passive forms of consumption lead us to nothing. I struggled
through the last sentence and decided to sub out everything because
there is no way to sugar-coat the fact. Unbridled consumption <strong>IS</strong> what is making us
as a group of people weak, incoherent, short sighted, antsy, ignorant
and even a little…or a lot on the <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_lG2az5ut9w0/Sw91s3I42zI/AAAAAAAAESA/1Ly8c1PdJEM/s400/+When_Breasts_Grow_On_Back_01.jpg">pudgy side</a>.</p>

<p>Although I may have wasted a good part of 3 hours hacking on “coloured
text,” I learned a lot about how Tmux works under the hood, and,
this is a biggy, I built <a href="http://pinterest.com/search/?q=cabin+porn">a space</a> that I love to be in. Who knows
what will happen in a few minutes, in a few days or even in a few
months. What I know now is I will continue to build kick-ass, elegant software for people
who demand it because my working environment is great…cue <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-b9Y6zR4LXUw/TdFioigALEI/AAAAAAAAJqM/eyAxRKF8LCU/s1600/Funny-Tony-The-Tiger.jpg">Tony</a>.</p>

<p>Also, although I am “American”, I actually spell the word: colour
correctly. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster">Webster</a> performed an egregious disservice to the English
language and I will never forgive him for his folly.</p>

        Vim Can Suck

    <span class="post-date">03 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>OS X is generally a wonderful operating system. Sure there are plenty of
<a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17phrnpizopotjpg/original.jpg">neckbeards</a> out there that would love to punch me in the balls for the
comment. On the opposite side of life, most designers would agree with
me down to the fact that they demand that all the fiddly buttons
are actually “<a href="http://youtu.be/-JFfN5pKzFU">lickable</a>.” Whatever that means. Several items both of
these camps should be able to agree on is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Package management is hard on OS X</li>
  <li>and lots of Apple’s built in “stuff” (you might call them apps but,
you would <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_management_system">be wrong in doing so</a>) kinda
blow.</li>
</ol>

<p>I happen to be a <a href="http://www.cloudbacon.com/posts/2011-12-20-Command-T-Sucks/">very opinionated</a> Vim user and over the past month
have experienced…issues with the version of Vim compiled through the
nice folks at Apple. Before we continue, there are some clerifications
that are due. The Vim I am banging on about isn’t <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> or the Vim that
is bundled within the /Contents section of the MacVim install.</p>

<p>My biggest beef stems from the fact that the version bundled with Lion,
Snow Leopard, Leopard, Tiger, and probably all the way back to 10.1 are compiled without Ruby and Python support. This can cause
several issues with popular plugins like <a href="https://wincent.com/products/command-://wincent.com/products/command-t">Command-t</a> and
<a href="http://sjl.bitbucket.org/gundo.vim/">Gundo</a> thereby rendering them useless when composing text. <em>READ</em>:
they don’t fucking work. Being a short bus ride away from Canada day -
America, the <a href="http://www.the-joke-box.com/pictures/tomahawk-utility-belt.jpg">4th of July</a>, I thought it appropriate to write a short
“how-to” in order to save potentially-awesome folk from this issue.</p>

<p>Ok, one more thing I am opinionated about is: <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>.
Seriously, if you use MacPorts, Fink, or whatever other piece of
ancient package manager-shit, you have issues that will eventually equate to
your downfall. In addition, I am not much of a fan of Homebrew’s stance
on not offering packages that “Duplicate functionality provided by OS X.”
Enter: brew taps.</p>

<p>To get this started we are going to assume you have Homebrew installed
and every thing is up to date. Hop back into a terminal and type:</p>

<p><code>
brew install mercurial
</code></p>

<p>Yeah, I <a href="http://www.cloudbacon.com/posts/2011-04-18-wordpress_to_ruby/">didn’t like it either</a> but so is life. Next:</p>

<p><code>
brew tap homebrew/dupes
</code></p>

<p>Agree to what it asks and make sure that your bashrc or zshrc file has
this path near the top</p>

<p><code>
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
</code></p>

<p>Now we have Homebrew set up to install system duplicate packages. Before
we set up Vim we need to switch back to the system compiled Ruby instead
of what we have set in Rbenv or RVM. Once that is done, life is a snap:</p>

<p><code>
brew install homebrew/dupes/vim
</code></p>

<p>Theoretically <code>brew install vim</code> will function nicely however, it is
always good to be explicit. If you would like to know some other
packages that fall into the realm of “dupes”, check out this <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes">Github
repo</a>. I have been using the Homebrew installed version all morning and by far it is faster and
more stable than what comes with Lion…DAMN you OS X for being so
brilliant and lacking at the same time!</p>
