        On Being Opinionated
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2011</span>

    <p>Winning eh (look at the tags at the bottom)? Remember the saying? The one that
everyone who who has ever dubbed themselves “nice” use when they feel
uncomfortable in conversations? Yeah it goes something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opinionated people suck</p>
</blockquote>

<p>well here is a better one</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last was quoted from Democritus. He might have just been some offbeat Greek
philosopher; however, he had a point. We can go through life worrying about the
opinions of others or we can be purposeful and understanding of the fact that
opinions are ubiquitous.</p>

<p>The people who choose the latter will be cursed with opinions that upset
people. And people are afraid of this, genuinely and honestly…ruffled.
Seriously, ask people.</p>

<p>If by chance you are remotely agitated about what someone has said, you have
one of two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stand up and say something at that very moment. Don’t let it fester and hope
  that you have a chance to raise it in the future.</li>
  <li>Do nothing. Throw it over your shoulder and forget about it. You lose
  nothing from just letting it go.</li>
</ol>

<p>Opinions are not evil, being overwrought with emotion about them, is.</p>

    <p>Twitter is always a good time(fact = NonDisputableItem.new). If you have ever
thought, just for a moment, that all you will hear is about people’s bowel
movements, you have emotional issues. Take this wonderful example from last
night…pure fucking genius!</p>

        MacBook Air and Five Apps
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 May 2011</span>

    <p><a href="http://patrickrhone.com/">Patrick Rhone</a> has a wonderful podcast and website
known as <a href="http://minimalmac.com/">Minimal Mac</a>. When he interviews guests he
asks, what he likes to call the “MacBook Air question.” The gist of the
question breaks down to: you are given the base <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MC505LL/A?mco=MTk0MjI1MTk">11-inch MacBook
Air</a> model and
you need to choose the five most important applications you would install on
it.</p>

<p>The idea is rather brilliantly minimal and definitely a fun and constricting
way to look at computer ownership. Most of us litter our computers with
applications that we hope, one day, might come of use. Anyway, here is my list:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> - All of my application launching (all
  five of them) goes through Alfred. In addition, you can fire off
  applescripts, command line arguments, open files in specific apps, move
  files around, control iTunes, and do just about anything…all without ever
  touching the mouse or trackpad.</li>
  <li><a href="http://agilebits.com/products/1Password">1Password</a> - Easily the go-to
  password manager(software) for the Mac. Within the last year, I moved all my
  passwords here and haven’t worried once because a web service may have
  leaked my password into the open. Completely indispensable in my mind.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim">Vim</a> - I have been a long time
  <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi/vim</a> user and there is no way I could find myself on a
  Mac without the ability to jump into the the best <a href="http://texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl">text
  editor</a> <em>ever</em> created. Yeah I said
  it, deal.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> - Dropbox paired with the Mac App Store
  is the only way to set up a new machine. In addition, Dropbox is great for
  keeping dot files, books I am reading, and other projects in sync across a
  myriad of different computers. Sure there might be some security issues of
  late but, who puts their credit card numbers in plain text files…named
  “credit card numbers” in their dropbox?</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> - Fuck iCal,
  Things, and every other lame calendar or “todo” application. Omnifocus is
  the grandaddy of
  <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">GTD</a>
  and will always be a staple on any Mac, iPhone, or iPad now and in the
  future. Let’s be honest, computers need to be more about getting complex
  stuff done over watching Youtube videos and trolling our friends “wicked
  awesome lives” on Facebook.</li>
</ol>

<p>If we were allowed 2 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_horse">dark horses</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">Textexpander</a> - Textexpander allows
  me to have a bank of snippets that get “expanded” into anything when a
  certain key stroke is completed. I have snippets for blogging, dates, email
  signatures, words I consistently misspell, and just about anything else.
  This application is definitely integral in my everyday work flow but, if
  push come to shove, it doesn’t make the top five.</li>
  <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/yorufukurou/">Yorufukoru</a> - Yorufukoru is the
  best Twitter application that no one has ever heard of or can say. It might
  not look as slick as the official Twitter client; however, it follows
  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIntro/XHIGIntro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957">Apple’s HIG
  guidelines</a>
  and embodies the simple yet, insanely powerful mentality.</li>
</ol>

        Malware Inside my Apple
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 May 2011</span>

    <p>Feel free to take a gander at this <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/crying-wolf-apple-support-forums-confirm-malware-explosion/3351">Cnet
article</a>
before continuing…</p>

<p>Yes, it appears that Apple desktops, not iPads and iPhones have become so
ubiquitous that they are now the target of <em>porn</em> malware. There are a few key
issues with this article that any Apple neophite can throw away (up?) as being
utter rubbish. Ed’s blog is called the “Microsoft Report” and said blog is
hosted on a humungoid network like Cnet. He probably is a little biased and
perhaps doesn’t use an Apple computer, the item he is blogging about, all that
often (hear-say, I don’t know for sure). In addition, you need to approve
<strong>everything</strong> that is installed on a Mac. This would mean that people are
OKing the malware to run, it isn’t “just running on its own.”</p>

<p>There just isn’t any way to spin this. There are a lot more people owning Apple
computers today compared with even a few years ago. You are bound to have
a couple more “<a href="http://yfrog.com/h06wreoxj">computer literate</a>” people in the
ecosystem now vs then. Want to stay safe? Take a good look at what you are
authorizing to run, every time your Mac bugs you. It takes 2 seconds, fur-real.</p>

        Cheap People = Craptacular

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 May 2011</span>

    <p>Being a proponent of expensive, yet long lasting items is often tough in a
world where everything is built to be disposable. Rarely ever do you get to be
apart of a conversation that focuses around “build quality” or obsolescence (a
word that many Americans fear more than the end of American Idol). However, it
is always refreshing when someone <a href="http://www.ajkesslerblog.com/being-frugal-makes-you-a-loser/">pokes the bee’s
nest</a> and starts
up a rather interesting conversation.</p>

<p>The one thing that is problematic in the article, is his usage of the word “frugal.” Frugal is
a word that should be used to describe the “hacker-money-saver” not the person
that buys loads of cheap shit. Aside from this, the post is spot on.</p>
