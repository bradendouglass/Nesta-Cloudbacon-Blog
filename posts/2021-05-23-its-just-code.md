title: It's Just Code

It's actually been quite some time since I have heard this phrase reiterated:

> It's just code

The emphasis here is on the 'code' part.

This 'callout' is a hallmark of senior/principle engineers who don't quite empathisis with the question at hand.
It's saying to the other party that there's a distinct lack of understanding on one side of the table.
Moreover, it belittles the person asking the question and likely makes them feel 'less of a developer'.
And if it doesn't,
it surely makes them think twice if they are 'worthy' to be at this table at all.
Better yet if the person raising the issue isn't at the table at all.

Say, it's a problem that's being synthesized by the folks at the table from responses from the wider engineering culture.
Because the response:

> It's just code

is so utterly flippant,
it teaches the senior and principle engineers that it's OK to approach problems of this kind with that response.
There's no need to reach and make anything better because...

> It's just code.

Unfortunately this is simply the wrong approach in almost all regards.
There's a key communication breakdown above all else but,
there is also a showcase of flagrant elitism
and denial that the issue affects anyone besides the person who raised the issue.

Software engineers of all levels really should take the time to view issues from all levels.
Pairing is one of the best ways to go about this,
as well as being quick to open any code up to quick feedback loops.
This might be opening a pull request up after the first WIP commit,
sharing branches of work with key product owners and pass code maintainers (`git blame`),
or even showcasing requests for proposals during demo days.

Although these items might not be 'as easy' as saying:

> It's just code

They go a long way in building a culture that's less about blame and more about exploration and pushing boundaries.
Questioning is half the battle when it comes to propelling engineering culture forward.
The other half is having a group of people who are willing to listen and either assist in changes,
or find others who will.
