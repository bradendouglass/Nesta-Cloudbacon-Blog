title: 2021 Programming Language Selection

In many posts throughout the years,
I have actively mentioned learning a new programming language every year:

1. [2020][2020]
1. [2018][2018]
1. [2017][2017]

The push to focus on a single new language to better one's career originates from Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their amazing tome:
[The Pragmatic Programmer][prag].
Having gone through this excersice for the past 9 years,
means there aren't a lot of mainstream languages left to explore.
Due to this,
[I reached out to the greater Twitter community][twit] to help deciding on what 2021 might look like.

### Choice 1

[Idris][idr], while a language that speaks to my love of types,
is still _extremely_ young.
And wthout a clear sense of metaprogramming in the standard library,
I might hold off on it until 2022 or 2023 even.
Saying that,
a language's age or adoption rate shouldn't deter folks from choosing it for a yearly project.
A great example being:
two years ago when I learned [ReasonML][reason].

### Choice 2

[Deno][deno],
while not a truly 'new' language,
does have a sense to it that makes it something different than [NodeJS][node].
The adoption of [Deno][deno] in [serverless][slss] and CLI tooling does have a huge overlap with the team I work with day-to-day.
This means that anything learned now,
could be relevant to life at [Glossier][glos] and [beyond][nete].
Which funny enough,
would be the first time work overlapped with a yearly language exploration... _Ever_.

2021 is going to be a year that the whole [serverless][slss] revolution sees high demand and adoption (IMHO).
There's a lot of space here to build 'mashup style' applications that have a thin vaneer of business logic and
a large swath of infrastructure.
Languages that can both build and run on these platforms will be relevant for anyone to explore in the coming year.

Also learning a language in 2021? [Reach out on Twitter][coms] and share!
