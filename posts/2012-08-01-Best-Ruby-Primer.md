Wait you, the reader, weren't aware I loved the little elegant and
quirky language that is [Ruby][1]? Well anyway, I am currently [reading][2]
a [book][3] about design paterns in Ruby. It is sort-of old (syntax wise), having been
written in 2007; however, still packed with some pretty great
[nuggets][4]. In particular, Russ Olson does a magnificent job of
summing up Ruby in the first chapter. If you are an accomplished [software
craftsmen][5] and are looking for a quick-and-dirty intro to a great
language, then this book is what you are <strike>torrenting</strike> looking for.
