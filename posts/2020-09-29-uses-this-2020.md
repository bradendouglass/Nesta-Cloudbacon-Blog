### What is this?

Over the 10 ish years,
I have been fascinated with the website: [usesThis][useThis].
It's a wonderful way to get the behind the scenes on the hardware and software that people use.
The folks who participate range from game developers to makers.
This leads to an ecclectic answering of the following 4 questions.

In the spirit of this format,
I figured it would be fun to write my own usesThis 'interview'.
So without producing too much intro fluff,
let's get started.

### Who are you and what do you do?

Heya, I'm Braden Douglass or 'phonetically' [@braidn][twit] throughout the web.
I am Fullstack, mostly Back-End leaning developer at [Glossier][glos].
Most of my arrant thoughts end up on my personal blog titled: [Cloudbacon][cb] and
I have a ton of odd projects strewed throughout [GitHub][gh].

In my off time,
I tend to be a bit of a programming language explorer.
At its core,
this means that I spend,
usually around a year,
to explore the ins and outs of a single programming language.
Some of the languages that I have had the honor to build software in span:

[Ruby][rb], [JavaScript][js], [TypeScript][ts], [Crystal][cl],
[Clojure][cj], [Elixir][ex], [Rescript/ReasonML][re], [GoLang][go],
[Elm][em], [Erlang][er], [Io][io], [Lua][lu], [Perl][pl],
and likely a few more along my journey.

I am also deeply interested in exploring sound [type systems][type].

### What hardware do you use?

Currently, my main computer is a late 2019 13' Macbook Pro.
Lots of folks seem to have problem with their 2016-2019 Macbooks.
They complain a lot about missing escape keys (more on this later),
poor keyboards, or wifi/bluetooth modules that are flakey.

If I am being completely honest,
I have never used an escape key that wasn't bound to caps lock.
That key's a whole lot closer to the home row than an esc key will ever be.
I also haven't used a built-in keyboard in such a long time due to the awesomeness that is the [HHKB][hkb].
They are smaller (60%) keyboards that have comfortable key travel and
plastic cases.
They can slip into a backpack and used without too many judging eyes under a coffee shop table.

Besides the HHKB,
there are a host of other keyboards that get plugged into the laptop.
A [Green M60-a][m60] with [Tealio switches][teal],
a [Modern M0110][m10] with [NOS SKCL Alps green][alps] switches,
and two [Norbauer][norb] TKLs.

Due to the Macbook having 4 really powerful Thunderbolt 3 ports,
when at home it get's plugged into a [Caldigit Thunderbolt][cd].
This feeds an old [27 inch MiniDisplay Port Apple Cinema Display][cinema]
and some random 24 inch horizontal Asus Monitor.
Other random things that are plugged into the Caldigit are 
some old [CST Trackball][cst] (when they were CST),
a hot swappable [Ergodox][ergo],
and a [Schiit Fulla][shit].

Due to some software choices (below),
I am pretty indept to the Apple ecosystem so my current phone
is an [iPhone 11 Pro][ifone].
A few years ago one of my phones experienced a random logic board failure and
so I have been apart of [Apple's rent-a-phone program][phone] ever since.
While the iPhone has had a slightly incremental design philosophy over the past few years,
I still pine for the old 4s/5 designs.
The glass backs shattered instantly and antenna gate but,
the blocky design was so fun versus the rounded corners of today's iPhones.

Everything digitally that I have ever owned is backed up to a [Synology DS918+][syn].
It's filled with 4 [4TB Iron Wolf Pro][wolf] NAS drives and utilizes an MSATA cache
runing 2 [256GB Samsung 960 EVO][evo] M.Sata drives.
This was a bit of an upgrade from an older Drobo and wowzers! 
The speed, throughput and functionality of these Synologies is spectacular.

For capturing life stills I adore anything from Fuji.
Currently I am using a [Xpro-3][xpro] and
both a [23 f2][lens1] and [35 f1/4][lens2].
The Xpro is so quirky with its' missing rear LCD howeve,
the pictures it produces are spectacular.
The 23 is what I predominatly travel with due to it being weather sealed and
, if I am being honest, I adore the focal length.
The 35 produces better images but,
it's much bulkier and tends to stay around the house due to no weather resistance.

For my scribbling needs I still turn to [Field Notes][fn] and
any pen with a [Schmidt easyFlow 9000][pen] refill.

### And what software?

99 % percent of all code originates in [NeoVim][nvim].
It's not a terrible environment and to be honest the,
built in Lua engine has led to some spectacular,
none-vimscript (or Python) plugins.
I also author most blog posts and slides in NeoVim as well.
At one time I was a huge believer in [Tmux][tmux] but,
over the years its rendering speed has fallen by the wayside.
This has led me to pickup [Kitty][term] as a terminal emulator
and leave the multiplexers behind.

[Homebrew][brew] and [Docker][dock] manage most of my environments.
Having an enviornment that's quick to spin up,
especially if I just dropped my laptop in the toilet,
has been a huge focus of mine over the years.
The tool that makes this possible (aside from HomeBrew and Docker) is
a tiny shell tool called: [strap][str].
At its' core it's the spiritual successor to [Boxen][bxn].

I use [Git][git] and [GitHub][gh] to be social around code
and as a tool for version control.
Any time I find something interesting on the web it gets saved to [Pinboard][pin] and
[Feedbin][bin].
Bookmarks and RSS are still some of the more simple ways to capture HTML based content.
When I want to read something longer-form, I reach for [Marvin][mar].
More technical books are read from [Safari Online's splendid iOS app][saf].

When it comes to planning work along with my life I lean heavily on [OmniFocus][of].
This one app has kept me on track throughout the past 10 or so years.
Overall I stick pretty heavily to a [GTD][gtd] mindset,
especially when it comes to the notion of contexts or 'spheres of focus'.
Productivity is usually divided into two parts:

1. One part for planning
1. And one part for research.

My streak using note taking tools has been considerably shorter than OmniFocus.
However, in the past year I have settled nicely into [Roam][roam].
Roam's ability to be come better the more info you throw at it is exactly what I need.
I produce a lot of written thought and using Roam's linking and query filters, 
allow me to easily navigate the jumble that is my brain.
Doing this efficiently with a markdown wiki would be impossible/extremely inefficient.
Any prose that's destined to get to [Roam][roam] or this blog usually starts life in [drafts][dfts].

I tend to explore the web privately using [Firefox Dev Edition][ffdev],
listen to music on [Spotify][spot],
and podcast through [Overcast][overc].
When I want to consume thoughts and opinions from 'humans',
I tend to reach for old school IRC using [Textual][tirc]
or just hang out on [Twitter][twt].

To wrangle all of this together (and across multiple screens),
I use a tiling window manager called [Amethyst][amy],
[Alfred][afred] as a launcher,
and bake a lot of hotkeys into my keyboards using [QMK][qmk]

### What would be your dream setup?

Maybe this will manifest itself soon but,
I would love a return of the 12 inch MacBook pro,
This time running a super retina screen and
some overclocked (A14x or z) Mac derived system on a chip.
Rocking 32 gigs of ram with some silly battery life.
Two 16:10 ratio monitors mounted on arms (one horizontal, one vertical),
a [Heil PR40][heil] on boom for my voice and
a [Canon EOS 7D][can] with a prime lense for crystal clear video content could round things off.

Perhaps something running the [caliber 9SAS][cal] dressed in steel for my wrist,
a 8-9" [Chef's knife from Carter][carter], and
an ergonomic [U80][rama] with whatever the silent linear of the week is.

Concerning software,
everything is pretty chill and likely will be for years.
For someone who pines for modal editing driven by xmonad tiled windows,
new software isn't something to look out for.
