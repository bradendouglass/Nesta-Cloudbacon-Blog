Uh, I know, another post on some kind of [sudo][1](see what I did there) [productivity][2] ideal.
Don't [fret][3] too much, you have 15 or so more days left of it.
Moreover, you can very well bet your [britches][4] that there will be
some kind of a ["half-way point"][5] toot tomorrow instead of anything
remotely resembling nerdtastic.

Right! [Note Cards][6]! Or "Capture Cards", as us <strike>un</strike>productive fools like
to call them, are great for grabbing all the little things that come
[flying by][7]. Those items that [bombard us][8] so quickly that we
don't have enough time to pull out our [iDevice][9] but, we need to jot
them down due to their [action-ability][10]. There are two really great
aspects that make note cards indispensible in this manner:

1. They are [mutable][11] objects... Meaning they are easily discarded
   and replaced. This simplicity allows them to be easily found, even if
   you show up empty handed.
1. They are non-threatening. When people pull out their phones they
   threaten the crowd with the fact that they (the crowd) are so boring
   that you need to "check-in".
1. You didn't think that you would get through a post on productivity
   without some kind of list did you? Good. Because that is actually impossible.
1. Number 4...ok, done.

What tools are required for all this malarkey?

###Cards:

1. [Behance Action Cards][12]
1. [Frictionless Action Cards][13]
1. [Levenger Cards][14]

###Cases:

1. [Moleskine][15]
1. [Steelmaster][16]

Go forth and be more productive with small cardz!
