title: Boredom To Getting Something Done
date: '2012-12-16'

Posts have been a little sparse lately due to me moving to a new job and needing
to learn how to 'do' [PHP][1] again. However, there has been a few instances where
I have found myself completely bored. To fight the need to tool around on [hacker news][2]
in these situations, I give you [this][3]

...

Oops, I actually meant [this][4]. It might be a little hard to 'grep' what's
going on in the picture but here is the idea. Whatever system you use to keep yourself
in-check and productive, probably utilizes tags or 'contexts' for the true [GTDers][5].
Create a tag that is as simple as 'Web'. The next part is hard but, with some simple
conditioning, success isn't far.

Start training yourself to look back at this context every time you find yourself
bored on the Internet. When you feel that nagging need to navigate to Facebook, Pinterest, or Pandora, stop.
Think about what you are doing, then click on your [productivity suite][6] of choice
and see what you [really could be doing][8].

This method hinges on a couple of things that are rather 'long tail' if an [Internet
consumption addiction][9] has already taken root. The biggest and by far the hardest
is [developing the habit][7] to look back at your todo-list every time you find your
focus wavering. However, if mastered, the things that might get finally finished
will astonish everyone. Give it a whirl and [hit me up on twitter][10] with the results!
