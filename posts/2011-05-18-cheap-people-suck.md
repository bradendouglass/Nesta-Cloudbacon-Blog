title: Cheap People = Craptacular

Being a proponent of expensive, yet long lasting items is often tough in a
world where everything is built to be disposable. Rarely ever do you get to be
apart of a conversation that focuses around "build quality" or obsolescence (a
word that many Americans fear more than the end of American Idol). However, it
is always refreshing when someone [pokes the bee's
nest](http://www.ajkesslerblog.com/being-frugal-makes-you-a-loser/) and starts
up a rather interesting conversation.

The one thing that is problematic in the article, is his usage of the word "frugal." Frugal is
a word that should be used to describe the "hacker-money-saver" not the person
that buys loads of cheap shit. Aside from this, the post is spot on.
