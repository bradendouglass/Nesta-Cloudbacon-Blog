title: Staging Your Personal SS

So much has happened since August and now. It is so actually incomprehensible
that I will leave my readership, what's left of it to only wonder. Perhaps the
absence has actually ran all the readers, who in fact can't read off and some
qualtity ones have returned. Alas, it is doubtful since the state of boredom
in America is [staggering these days][1]. Yep, we are so tired of stairing at our iPads we have resorted
to writing articles on chewing food. Sorry if the following doesn't trump that.

Recently I have been thinking considerably about the need, and use of staging
branches. No, not servers, just the branches. Often times mine is in a state
of `reset --hard` disaray. The reflog reflects the final 100 pages in Umberto's
freebasing masterpiece [The Island Of The Day Before][2] (there is a good reason
why the audio cassette can be picked up for 1 cent). To top it all off? This
branch rarely-if-ever gets synced with GitHub.

This is where many purest string me up and make finely cured meat out of me.
Moreover, myself 1-2 years ago would have been right with them. However, now I simply
see no point in it. Staging is as tumultuous as this [video][3] or at best, the way
[Douglass Adams describes the meaning of 'life'][4]. Staging, an active staging, is in
constant flux, never complete, always on the move. Due to all of this, keeping it
in sync seems like a foolish persuit. Maybe I am missing something? If so shoot me
a message [on Twitter][5] and make sure it is full of witty expletives.

Also on a much bigger note, watch out for other, somewhat better written (I think
there might even be editors involved) articles over at [Dynamo's new bluurrrg][6].
It's guarenteed to be [600%][7] better than this has ever been... Even when
this place was owned by the Swedish Anti-Powerpoint party.

[Be safe, be seen][8]
