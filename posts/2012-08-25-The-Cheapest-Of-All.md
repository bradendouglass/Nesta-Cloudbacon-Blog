title: The Cheapest Of All

I happened across [this article][1] this week and was rather
unastonished to hear that we are the cheapest generation ever.
Since many of my readers [can't actually read][3] here is a quick
one-over.

Apparently the Millenials aren't doing the [same shit][4] in the [same
way][5] as our parents. Oh, and this is bad btw, if you couldn't infer
it. We are waiting until we hit [middle age][6] to think about new cars or
our first house. In addition, this kind of "[fiscal responsibility][7]"
is tanking the [great state of USA][8] and pushing it into the path of [this][9].

My response to 99% of this article and [75% of 100% of life][10] is:

> Bullshit

For starters, the "Global Stragegic Marketing" dude from GM in the [Atlantic][4] article
is [tripping balls][11]. You are 31, which means that you are only 4 or
so years away from being one yourself. Does this mean you don't know who
you are? Likely. The rest of the article and the concept are right on,
along with some of the responses that have cropped up over the past few
days.

We don't care, as a group of people, to be overly encumbered with
things. This doesn't make us [this asshat][12]. But, it does make us
conscious of every purchase we make. It has nothing to do with the
instability of our jobs(which definitely exists), or the lack of jobs in
general. It all boils down to one word: Freedom. Does your product get
us a little closer to attaining it? No? Well fuck off(said by a
generation of people with their wallets closed and their minds [sudo][13] open).
