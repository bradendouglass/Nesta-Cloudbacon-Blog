title: Truths Not So Vigilantly Held.

Software engineers are pretty great at holding onto ideas for...
Well, what feels like finfinity.
Some grey-beard will impart some slice of knowledge that completely blows us away when we were junior engineers.
Years later,
seemly with little validation,
we continue to clutch so dear to this knowledge.
We even pass it around to other newly juniored engineers or in peer groups as if it's some kind of gospel.
However,
these 'nuggets of gold' are often opinions that should be loosly held,
rigorously tested on a yearly interval,
and continually explored with other engineers in your discepline (front-end/back-end).

Over the *entirety of 2020* I began to question and
think a little differently concerning some of the above.
The following is a list of opinions that I gathered, let go of, and ultimatly kept in my clutches.

The structure of this post is highly influenced by [this wonderfully written piece][post]

### Items Dropped

-   TDD is the only way to build great software. TDD is one great way, there are so many more
-   Never copy and paste. Not everyone has used Vim for a bajillion years.
-   Being correct is not some form of 'winning'. Listening and being mindful is.

### Things Learned/Accumulated

### Opinions Still Closely Clutched!
