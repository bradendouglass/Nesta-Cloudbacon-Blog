title: Cocks At A Conference
date: '2012-08-03'

I admit it, I am kind of bad at this whole conference scene thing. I love
meeting people but most of the time they force themselves into talking
points instead of bringing things up naturaly. Of course this will
happen due to the large amount of people interacting with each other
over a short amount of time. We just aren't that skilled, nerd or not.

Besides the hallway track which often turns into the simple "toot toot", you have the random person that can't keep their face out of their
laptop or scribbling on their iPad...Therebye, giving-up said: toot-toot factor.
Asshats basically, lots and lots of Asshats. Close that shit, get the twinky out of your mouth,
listen to the presenter and quit being a fuckup.

After all why on earth are you at this conference? To tick off some
imaginary box for a raise? Why are you programming? Go ahead, ask yourself that
NOW. It's free and maybe you can write the file down on your iPad.

I know that I said that there would be some fun links included in these
posts. So why is this one so angry...and dry you might ask? Well for
starters I severely dislike this type of a person and this exact file
was finished from my phone at 11:45 pm tonight.
