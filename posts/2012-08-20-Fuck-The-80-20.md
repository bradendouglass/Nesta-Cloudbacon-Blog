title: Fuck The 80/20 Rule
date: '2012-08-20'

Do you know what all this [80/20][1] shit is about? If not feel free to
[go here][2] and be [enlightened][3]. Don't get me wrong, the rule works
real well when used in the vertical that is business. 80% of your
terrible experiences come from 20% of your customers. [I get it][4], I
really do. The problem lies when the 80/20 rule is used in this domain:

> I will make 80% of my time perfect and the other 20 can be "whatever",
> or "meh", or "shit".

People pull this [stunt][5] with diets, excersise, getting things done,
everything. Again, I understand! No one is perfect and as you [approach
perfection, actual perfection becomes harder and harder to attain][6].
My [beef][13] with the idea stems from the [lazy factor][7]. People, with
diligence and some elbow grease could iron out that unwieldy 20%
eventually.

Yet they don't. They idly stand by and watch [life fly by them][8], all
while assuming what they are doing is [A-OK][9]. Since this is my blog
and apparently the way things are going these days, advice column, this
is a good way to [break out][10] of the aforementioned
[mediocrity][10]...Don't do it.

You were beting on a list [weren't you][11]? Nope. If you are sucking
20% of the time today, suck 19% tomorrow. [Whittle][12] away at it at
your own pace but, promise me, never be happy with the number 20.

In closing: butter sculptures will never count for the 20%
