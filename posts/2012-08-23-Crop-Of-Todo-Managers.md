There are a lot of good ones out there at the moment, so without further
ado, here is your [list][1]

###Incumbents

The two that come to mind in this category are [Things][2] and
[OmniFocus][3]. Both have iPhone and accompanying Mac apps and both
sync seamlessly between the two platforms. Things lacked this functionality in the
past but, it has recently been updated. Full disclosure, I am a
super-fan of OmniFocus and I also feel anything designed and or nudged
by [Merlin Mann][4] and [Ethan Schoonover][5] is worth checking out /
using until they make something new.

Regardless of bias, both of these applications will work well for your
daily to-do's, with OmniFocus being much more tailored to the [GTD][6]
methodology.

###FO Freeze

The two that we will talk about (there are quite a few in this category)
are the [Apple Reminders app][7] and [Wunderlist][8]. Both of these apps
will set you back a grand total of 0 [Yankee Dollar-y-Doos][9] and both
will sync between your Apple powered devices. Wunderlist will even work
in a browser, Windows, and Linux. Both of these are more traditional
list managers and have fewer (read: [less complex][10]) frivolous
features.

If you are in the market for a sleek, simple, and free app, take a
[stroll][11] and give one of these a whirl.

###Webby

The three we will go over briefly (because really to get an idea of how
they work, you should be trying them out) are [Asana][12],
[Chedder][13], and [Flow][14]. These applications aren't _only_ for the
web, all three of them have a mobile component, and Chedder even has an
early stage Mac client. Chedder is a really simple and fast set of lists
where Flow attempts to recreate the Things experience (half-hearted GTD)
on the web and Asana is great for working with teams.

###Fin

There is a really quick, and dirty rundown of the current crop of [task
managers][15]. My recommendations? Give each one a whirl and see what
fits your lifestyle. Some of us have complex, "big boy" needs, while
others benefit from a simple list manager.
