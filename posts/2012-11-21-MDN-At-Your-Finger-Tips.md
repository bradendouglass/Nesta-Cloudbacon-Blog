title: MDN At Your Finger

Disclaimer: this tip centers around the use of [Alfred][1] but, doesn't
require the premium "Power Pack". [MDN][2] is...or should be a go-to for
anyone doing any level of front-end development. It is an indispensible
knowledge base on anything concerning HTML, CSS, or Js. Since Alfred has
a great way to add custom searches, we can pipe items into Alfred and
have it pass the search onto MDN.

The string to get this started is:

`https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q={query}`

MDN also encodes spaces as `+` symbols so one will have to check the
appropriate box within the Alfred Custom Search settings.

Now, if you have a question about how `line-height` works you can simply
type `mdn line-height` and [__BOOM__][3], stupendous success.
