Software development, as a profession,
is a super quick moving behemoth.
Let's take the state of the current front-end over the past 10 years:

- 10 Years ago we were shipping a large monolithic library (jQuery) to all clients.
- 6 Years ago we were writing everything in white space indented Coffeescript
- 2 Years ago we were bundling our single page apps with [webpack][wpk]
- Today we are doing no bundling during the developement process [snowpack][snp]

Whatever is the chosen path for a developer (back-end, front-end, devops),
the process of staying up to date and relevant is going to be a never-ending blitz.

Often times companies utilize this fact to entice developers with a robust 'learning and development' budget.
Sometimes these are as low touch as a prepaid Visa card per year,
where others are a pooled amount of money alloted to specific purchases.
Some policies are more inclusive than others but,
the thing that really matters is that a policy exists and is available to everyone.

If you are interviewing for a developer job at any company,
I can't stress enough pushing for information around learning and development during the [reverse interview process][proc].
If for some reason the company is small and they have a fixed budget,
cool!
Anyone can work within a fixed budget.
Perhaps some years specific devs use more than others;
switching on the subsequent years.

However, if the story is that there is no learning and development budget...
Well that's a lot like the following:
