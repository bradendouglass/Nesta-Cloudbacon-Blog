title: A Case For Consolidation Of Words

There are [quite][w1] a [few][w2] [posts][w3] around here that highlight the power of writing.
Either through the lens of a remote programmer or
using the medium as a force multplier for education purposes.

Throughout the past couple of years,
I have stepped away from public writing (this space),
and focused on actual writing and working in an 'open' [Wiki space][wiki].
This meant that alot of work never really made it into the open.
Anything offline was tucked away in [Field Notes][fn] or
a [Baronfig Confidant][bf] and the only digital item being tucked into GIT.

For most folks,
GitHub isn't a super easy way to consume prose style content.
Coupled with my use of physical paper,
I realized that I was building a fairly extensive 'semi-digital' garden but,
all of it behind a high wall.
All of this is what lead to moving __everything__ to [Roam Reasearch][roam] earlier on this year.

This meant porting [Robert Pirsig's][rp] 'programmers shop manual',
all of my [wiki][wiki],
an entire year of [Agenda][agenda],
and five years of [Day One][done] into a completely new platform.
One that didn't have any offline capabilities,
mobile app,
or even a mobile site (as of January 2020).
A 'leap of faith',
especially for someone who could be considered a zealot about writing and journaling,
was putting it mildly.
So how did the experience turn out?

Having re-tooled a lot of my note taking around [Agenda][agenda]
and focused on a more '[Zettelkastan][zk]' approach that worked on a day-to-day basis,
Roam was an easy fit.
Linking to notes and especially linking to specific blocks (think nested bullet points),
added an even easier way to link notes to one another,
versus just through tagging.
This, coupled with the markdown import feature for all of my [wiki][wiki] content,
made moving pieces of my brain from one system into Roam a dawdle.
However, there is one system of mine that I couldn't quite understand how to port to Roam.

[Task management][tsk] and [productivity][prod] are often topics of discussion around here.
[Therefore it should come to no surprise that I am an avid][twit] [OmniFocus][of] 'zealot'.
Having started using it way back in 2009,
I naturally have a proclivity to being productive the way OmniFocus expects.
Focusing on task management in this capacitiy and with the assistance of OmniFocus,
is why I am where I am in my life.

After several weeks of __just__ Roam as a task tool,
it became obviously clear that I required a more native approach with text-to-speach integration and
a way to email todos directly into a system.
This really isn't a bad thing though.
Roam is more the research arm of my task management.
It's a place where higher level and longer lived projects live.
Think workspaces for entire projects,
spaces for quarterly goal planning or tracking,
and long form writing styled: weekly retrospectives.

Both systems see links to one another all and
I don't see this changing anytime soon.
They both have their distinct purposes however,
I am deeply happy with the consolidation of research,
gardening, knowledge wrangling, journaling, and all shop manuals into Roam.
The product has already changed considerably over the nearly 10 months of use and
there doesn't seem to be anything that the feverish community can't wedge into the tool.

If you are looking for something to consolidate your writing,
I can't recommend it enough.
