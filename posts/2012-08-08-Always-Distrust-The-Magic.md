title: Distrust The Magic
date: '2012-08-08'

If you spend enough time working with computers there is a good chance
you might [stumble][1] onto some [magic][2]. This doesn't mean that you
might randomly see unicorns while tracking down your next [porn-s-cipade][3],
frankly this is normal. No, the magic that will be reamed on, neglected,
yelled at, and belabored for the rest of this post is that of utter
[deception][4].

Programmers are really good at hiding away all the hard things in this
magic. They wrap it up in little quiant boxes, with buttons and
checkboxes that..."just work." We see this with Windows Server.
Everything is just a click away, all along while the user has no idea
how to actually __DO__ any of it. In their mind they build a network of
roads, all of which lead to desired solutions. We don't know how the
roads are leveled, what goes into the mixture, how they are laid, etc.
We just know how to use them.

This is a [blessing][5], wrapped in an duck all shoved into a
wonderful [enema][6]. This cripples us. We don't understand how any of
the underlying items fuction or how they interact with each other to
_actually_ make something work. Rails, Windows, OS X, all of it should
be rooted through, explored, tested, and ultimately broken. Set up
environments, test, test, test, and more important than anything:
[attempt to do your worst][7].

This is a really complex topic, one that can't be put to justice with
just one post. The plan? Extrapolate the magic further and smatter it
throughout a couple more posts. Come back tomorrow...or whatever.
