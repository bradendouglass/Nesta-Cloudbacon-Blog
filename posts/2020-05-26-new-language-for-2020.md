title: 2020 Programming Language

One of the best things any programmer can do is focus on a new language every year.
This concept was highlighted best in the book: [Pragmatic Programmer][prag].
The idea of investing regularly in a trade is something that any aspiring master 'crafts-human' works towards.

Over the past 12 years,
I have taken this idea farely seriously and attempted to learn something new each year.
Whether it be figuring out type systems in [Haskell][hskl] or [ReasonML][rml],
or building weird UI's in [Elm][elm].

It really doesn't matter how complex of a system is built in the language,
the mere fact that a programmer stretches their brain will do wonders for their [day-to-day work][glos].
So... It's June (nearly June) of 2020 so what language did I happen to choose this year?

Truth be told, there isn't one.
This will be the first time since 2007 where I choose to learn a concept,
not a language.

The whole wide world of [Devops][devoops] has exploded in the past year.
Bringing real programming languages
(if you consider [JS][js] a programming language)
to the world of declarative templating.
[Cloudformation][cfm], [Terraform][tfm], [Ansible][afm], [Chef][chef] were all interesting ways to represent [infrastructure as code][iac].
However,
all of them had a fairly terrible testing story,
and no great way (my opinion) to programatically build infrastructure.

The world of [AWS' CDK][cdk] and [Pelumi][pul],
coupled with the concept of [GitOps][gops] has brought a very compelling idea to representing infrastructure.
With that,
Hello [TDD][tdd] based Infrastructure and 'GitOps'.
You are my 2020 programming language.

Oh yeah, most of these concepts are constructed in [Typescript][tsc] (2017's language of the year)
and [JavaScript][js] (all the way back in 2007 then again in 2011).
