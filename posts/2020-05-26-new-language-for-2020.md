title: 2020 Programming Language

One of the best things any programmer can do is focus on a new language every year.
This concept was highlighted best in the book: [Pragmatic Programmer][prag].
The idea of investing regularly in a trade is something that any aspiring master works towards.

Over the past 12 years,
I have taken this idea farely seriously and attempted to learn something new each year.
Whether it be figuring out type systems in Haskell or ReasonML,
or building weird UI's in Elm.

It really doesn't matter how complex of a system is built in the language,
the mere fact that a programmer stretches their brain will do wonders for their day-to-day work.
So... It's June (nearly June) of 2020 so what language did I happen to choose this year?

Truth be told, there isn't one.
This will be the first time since 2007 where I choose to learn a concept,
not a language.

The whole wide world of Devops has exploded in the past year.
Bringing real programming languages
(if you consider JS a programming language)
to the world of declarative templating.
Cloudformation, Terraform, Ansible, Chef were all interesting ways to represent infrastructure as code.
However,
all of them had a fairly terrible testing story,
and no great way (my opinion) to programatically build infrastructure.

The world of AWS' CDK and Pelumi,
coupled with the concept of GitOps has brought a very compelling idea to representing infrastructure.
With that,
Hello TDD based Infrastructure and 'GitOps'.
You are my 2020 programming language.

Oh yeah, most of these concepts are constructed in Typescript (2017's language of the year)
and JavaScript (all the way back in 2007 then again in 2011).
