title: Don't Raise Your

I have been spending the better part of the morning listenin' to Ska. If
this directly affects the quality of this post, no [one cares][1].

###The Setup

The break out sessions begins at your local [hack knight][2] and you are
attending by yourself. What do you [do][3]? Surrounded by people who you
only [assume are smahter than yourself][4] (yes smart is spelled
[correctly][5]), you freeze, lock up and choke under pressure. Nothing
like [these people though][6] though..."colloquial term" __LEVEL UP__!

See! You are already a few steps ahead; however, you hold yourself back
because of some, or all of the below reasons (don't hate, Friday may as
well be one [big list day][7]).

###The List

1. [Offending someone][8]
1. [Being "Different"][9]
1. [Not knowing what to talk about][10]
1. [Weird silences][11]
1. [Saying something dumb][12]

With that, we are done here. A couple really sweet tips that have taken
me a long way that definitely couldn't hurt. Check out a recent talk by
an awesome person named: [Corey Haines][13]. Its first run was while he was
visiting Steel City Ruby Conf in Pittsburgh this year. I could have
sworn Confreaks was there so keep refreshing until it shows up. It is
well worth the 30 minutes of your time. And, finally the moment that kareoke
machine is brought out, you be the first to the mike. Yep...win!
