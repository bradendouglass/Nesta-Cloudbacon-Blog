[SXSW][1] is right around the corner and anyone who
has ever been before knows that they spend an inordinate amount of time getting
ready. Probably a considerable amount of time more, than let's say, Keisha
trying to figure out how to spell her name at the DMV. If by chance you have no
fucking clue what "South By South West" (duh, the "X" is in place of the "B")
is, please take the time out of your day from "Youtub-ing" Justin Bieber and do
some research. Anyway, sudo-funny dude [Alex Blagg][1] has compiled this video to
help you out:
