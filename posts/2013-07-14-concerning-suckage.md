Having just gotten off the "Skype-phone" with a fairly laid-back interviewer, I realized I get jittery in interviews.
By jittery, I don't mean I start to sweat profusely and mumble like a beaten school child but, more along
the lines of: deer in headlights. And the kicker? The question wasn't all that hard, perhaps even a "[soft ball][2]":

>What is new in Rails 4?

I could of said: Dali cache digest, Russian doll caching, pSQL arrays, turbolinks, or PATCH but, NO!
All that could eke out of my mouth was "Parameters in the Controller vs the Model". Which [doesn't even make
a lot of sense][1]. So as the folks at Thoughbot say:

>you need to know your weaknesses

mine happens to be headlights...
