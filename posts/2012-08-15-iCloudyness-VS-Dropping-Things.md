title: iCloud VS Dropbox

I am well aware that there was a promise made to deliver on a half-way
point post about this whole 30 day challenge. However, this isn't it. So
quit your [bitchin][1].

There have been a few posts lately (mostly on those blogs that rake in
the real [dough][2]) highlighting people's usage of [Dropbox][3] and [iCloud][4].
Both are great ways to sync data across [multiple devices][5] and both
seem to be "[manageable][6]" when staying within their [free domain][7].
So they're tools, free, and do the same thing; what makes them
different?

For starters, Dropbox is [rooted][8] in the old-timey idea of a file
system. You, the user create [obnoxiously deep][9] folder structures to house
files you don't really care about because the likely-hood of you
retrieving them through memory is slim at best. iCloud on the
[other hand][10] pulls all that shit away from the user and makes
syncing app related. This means that apps keep track of the files, not
some weird folder grouping.

Before I go into how I use iCloud (because frankly I use Dropbox like
everyone else: it is a cluster of folders that contain items I only
find on [accident][11]), I want you, the reader to understand that I am
very opinionated....k, thx.

Why use both? iCloud and its app specific file syncing makes it great
for keeping loose amounts of stuff around. Particuarly stuff from [Day
One][12] or any app that you might care little about. You can just chuck
shit in, and not worry about the way files are handled. This freedom
allows the writer to create without ever worrying if he/she will find it
again. I find it liberating. This idea of a
[flat file system][13] is pretty fucking Genius, and I am rather
interested to see where Apple is going with it.

Something awesome: RiserFS / BTRFS mixed with a flat system + git.
Fucking epic!
