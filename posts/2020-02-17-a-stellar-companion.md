Ever since the Apple stuffed _only_ USB C ports into their Macbooks,
everyone has been on the 'dongle' train.
Issue is,
and honestly it's common place that we all forget requirements,
we have always been a slave to the cable.

Ever plug a computer into a TV, monitor?
There's a cable there.
A keyboard and ergonomic mouse (sometimes known as a 'trackball')?
Another cable.
Want to charge that iPhone?
More cables.

Regardless of the computer you have,
cables and perhaps a dongle or two are a mainstay in eveyrone's bag.
Over the years these have been spread out throughout a backpack and duffle sidebags.
In 2019 I decided to do a little consolidation around this mess and gave the following a whirl:

Waterfield as a brand has been on the bag radar for some time.
They are well known for their impeccably made waxed canvas and leather bags and accessories.
Due to much of their designs being a bit too 'professional' I usually look elsewhere.
Except when it comes to pouches and sleaves (and mostly only recently).

When the time came to consolidate my cable and dongle carry,
I needed something that could slide into the very back slot of a Mission Workshop Rhake.
This tech forward,
city focused bag has a small horizontal pocket in the large main compartmant.
It's a perfect space to hide away for a cable cache.
However, it's very thin (width wise) and quite deep.

Laying out smaller items in this section,
without a pouch of some kind would be nearly impossible.
On top of this,
finding a pouch that isn't too thick,
so as to not drive into the wearers' back,
would be equally tricky.

Take the Belroy Tech Kit for example.
It has ample storage but,
falls short on being entirely to stout length wise and therefore it is entrirely too wide.
Same goes for the Peak Designs Tech Pouch.
Both of these in their own right are wonderfully designed but,
fall short in a space that is width constrained.

Enter the Waterfield tech pouch,
specifically the larger variant of the two.
With a single zippered pocket and a clever magnetic largeer opening,
there isn't any worry of wearing out any hardware when frequently plugging in that HHKB.
With the following cables and dongles,
this little pouch still remains svelte and can easily slip into the back of the Rhake:

1. USB C -> USB C
1. USB C -> Lightning
1. USB C -> USB Mini
1. USB A -> Lightning
1. USB A -> USB Mini
1. USB C -> Digital AV Multiport 'dongle'
1. USB C -> USB A 'dongle'

Without something wrapping this chaos,
this pocket would be relatively impossible to tame.
This plus everything would pile onto the very bottom (this thing called 'gravity' or something) of this pocket.


When arriving at the coffee shope,
office,
or 9F that's always a bit too short compared to the other seats on the plane,
leaving this pouch on the desk won't give you away as a mechanical keyboard carrying programmer.
Instead you have an intricatly made pouch wrapping all that chord madness.
