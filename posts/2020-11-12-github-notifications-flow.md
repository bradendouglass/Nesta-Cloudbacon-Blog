title: Taming GitHub's Notification Flow
date: '2020-11-13'

Recently on our corporate blog: [Into The Tech][med],
[I wrote][red] about how to stymie the flow of GitHub notifications.

While not great and somewhat unending,
GitHub really does offer a wonderful way to slice and dice notifications.
Most devs ignore this entire feature set of GitHub,
clicking ignore or banishing them from their inbox forever.
This post reformulates why those notifications might be worthwhile to keep around and
focuses on specific tactics to keep notifications actionable.

Now there's no reason to leave a co worker hanging on their code review request!
Give [the post a read][red] and feel free to [reach out on the socials][twit]
to share any tips you use to aid in a more clear collection of GitHub notifications.
