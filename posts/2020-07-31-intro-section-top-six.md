title: Introducing The Top Six
date: '2020-07-31'

At the top of the homepage,
a few things have changed (for the eagle eyed' reader)!

This new top six space will be a slightly revolving piece
that highlights posts that new readers may find interesting.
These posts will help them get a better understanding of how I write,
What I write about,
and what the main focuses continue to be on this blog.

For folks who have been subscribed to the RSS feed for awhile,
This section might not be super relevant.
However, for folks who are new here,
this section will be invaluable versus wading through a sea of posts.

These changes mirror the ideas that were highlighted from a post
by Dave Parell titled:
__[The Ultimate Guide To Writing Online][write]__

With this, hopefully new readers never feel lost (completely) here.
