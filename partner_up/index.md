##Mission -->

I hold three things close to my heart when I am working with a team,
consulting for a business, or subcontracting:

> Become entrenched in the success of the project. How much money are we
going to save/make the business when the project is finished?

> Take pride in every facet of the project. How can we effectively
alleviate technical debt now, not when the project has finished?

> Be a solution (brilliant or otherwise)

##Pitch -->

Currently, I am not taking on any side work.
However, if you think your idea is compelling
and want to sell me on it feel free to get in contact.
I love to talk shop and who knows what might happen from there.
