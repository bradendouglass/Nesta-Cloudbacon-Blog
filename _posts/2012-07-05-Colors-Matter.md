So what did everyone do yesterday (4th of July) instead of blow shit up
and drink too much beer? Unfortunatly an hour of work turned into three
wrestling with [Tmux][1], specifically the way information is presented
on the [lower bar][2]...or whatever it is called. Afterwards, I had a
conversation with my roommate concerning what we had done during the day
for "work." When we concluded, he made a snippy joke about
"leaving me to my colored text." For a second (just a hot one) I realized that he was perhaps
right in the sense that I was pissing my day away.

His comment, unlike normal,  stuck with me
through the rest of the day. Through fireworks, copious amounts of beer,
Crossfit chit chat, everything really. The thing is, when we are forced
to do work with tools [that we don't enjoy][3], our work begins to
reflect our [attitude][4]. It seeps into every little nook and cranny and it
infects us. Often-times in ways that we could never begin to imagine.

To cope we turn to things that might infuse us with happiness. We look for solace in
Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, and especially buying needless amounts of
shit. These passive forms of consumption lead us to nothing. I struggled
through the last sentence and decided to sub out everything because
there is no way to sugar-coat the fact. Unbridled consumption __IS__ what is making us
as a group of people weak, incoherent, short sighted, antsy, ignorant
and even a little...or a lot on the [pudgy side][5].

Although I may have wasted a good part of 3 hours hacking on "coloured
text," I learned a lot about how Tmux works under the hood, and,
this is a biggy, I built [a space][7] that I love to be in. Who knows
what will happen in a few minutes, in a few days or even in a few
months. What I know now is I will continue to build kick-ass, elegant software for people
who demand it because my working environment is great...cue [Tony][6].

Also, although I am "American", I actually spell the word: colour
correctly. [Webster][8] performed an egregious disservice to the English
language and I will never forgive him for his folly.
