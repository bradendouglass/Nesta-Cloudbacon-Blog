If you don't know what [splat][1] means than you are in the wrong
place. If you do! Well [huzzah][2] (possibly NSFW), keep reading. It
happens to be a [Monday][3], and Mondays happen to proceed the epically
boring Sunday. Equally boring, Mondays are rife for some positive [list
production][4].

Unlike a few weeks ago, where we looked at some small things that were
going on in the community, today we will run [down the opposite][5].
Without going too much into depth (wouldn't want to spoil it), here are
just a few things "[I couldn't be bothered to give two shits][6]"...about.

1. [Twitter's New TOS][7]: Or API changes, or whatever. When it comes
   down to it, a small fraction of people actually use Twitter. In
   addition, an __EVEN__ smaller section know what a 3rd party app is.
   [Google ++,][9] Twitter is the new Facebook, everyone wants to [hate on it][8]
1. [Apple V Samsung's Big Knobby Vibrator][10]: Suriously, there is so
   much to link to, I just dumped something in there. There was a
   verdict, now someone is crying, so there isn't now. Who the fuck
   cares. Oh, one more thing, Samsung and all of their [letters][11].
   Actually, if Fortune 500's could just [quit with the memos][12] all
   together, that would [be nice][13]
1. [New MS Logo][14]: [Snore][15]...

Ok and here are some things to coutneract [all that negativity][16]

1. [VMWare joining OpenStack is hella cool][17]
1. [The ever lovable Bob is hanging around at Apple][18]
