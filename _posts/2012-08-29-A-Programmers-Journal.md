title: A Journal

If you aren't quite as [addicted][1] to [Hacker news][2] as most of us
are, this is a reaction to [this post][3]. In the past few days, the
idea/[topic][4](HMM...Visual Basic 4, sure brings back [memories][5]) of
a programmers journal seems to be gaining steam on the interwebs. The
idea is really quite simple:

> Keep a journal of daily things, todos, hang ups, ideas, etc that
> pertain to only the world of programming. You can look back on them
> and quantify the tragectory of your [thought process][6]

Pretty cool huh? Not sure if it needed to be a block quote but it
happened. The above post really advocates keeping a physical journal ([as
do I][7]); however, I was quite surprised how many people use text files instead.
Why?

Yes, many programmers are generally concerned about creating a lot of
paper waste. Most of our jobs are designed to rid the workplace of paper
alltogether. This space though, _just_ the programmer's journal space,
should be filled with great [physical][8] notebooks. [Edison][9], [Tesla][10], and
[Darwin][11] all kept a journal, and I am 99% positive that theirs weren't
unmanagably long text files. Without further ado, a list. Here are my top requirements for a good,
real, paper programmers journal.

1. It must be bendy and [13x21][12] cm or larger. I have never been a fan
   of Moleskine's notebooks (although the new [Evernote one][13] could
   be cool) but, their journals are fairly great. The only thing missing
   in their exhaustive line is a dot grid option and I would leap on
   that in a second if a chance were to arise.
1. The notebook should exude creativity but contain the user within a
   small grid. That is why lined and blank books don't really work.
   Grids are good and dots are about as good as you can get. [Rhodia][12] has a great product; however,
   all of their notebooks have a hard cover. which goes against the
   whole idea of "bendy."
1. A great pen and pencil. Yep both! Most of the time I use a [pen][13]
   from Zebra or [Pilot][14] and a lead holder from [Rotring][15].
   Experiment and find what you like in your hands.

As I mentioned yesterday, it is hard to incorporate something new, and
perhaps difficult into your daily routine. With a notebook, slide it
between your [keyboard][16] and monitor. That way it is always in the
way of you and your creativity.

Fin...just promise me: "Don't use a fucking text file for your
programming journal"
