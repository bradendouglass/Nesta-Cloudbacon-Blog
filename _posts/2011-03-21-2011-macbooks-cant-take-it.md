title: 2011 MacBooks Can't Take It

![Fry an egg on a mac][1]

Yes, I know it is a Sunday night and there are much "cooler" things going on
like [@Marco's][2] [#dickbar][3] post. Or
perhaps the [shit going down between AT$T and T-Mobile][4]? So why focus on something as trivial
as a bunch of overheating Macs?

Buying a MacBook Pro, at least for the past 5 years, and a PowerBook before
that meant that you were paying a little extra money to get your grubby mits on
a machine of potentially insane power. With this quad-core
[Macbook Pro][5] refresh, consumers have
access to amazing portable computers. However, said computers aren't devoid of
a few serious bugs. First to appear was the [ominousÂ flicker][6]
when one of Apple's very own Apple Cinema Displays was plugged into the new
[thunderbolt / mini display port][7].
Now, people are seeing their powerhouses [hard freeze under load][8].

A bleeding-edge technology like Thunderbolt (how the fuck do you write that
btw? is it Thunderbolt, Thunderbolt port, the thunderbolt?) is bound to exhibit
some kinks but, a computer that is given an insane amount of raw processing
power (I am serious jealous and I have a first gen unibody 17 which is no
slouch) faltering when you throw something complex at it? Something definitely
is wrong. If anyone has purchased one of these little beasties and you are
experiencing some of the issues mentioned
[in this thread][9] you are in luck. What you may or may not realize is, you purchased
the right computer.

Take it back. Apple, knows these issues are occurring and will swap out your
computer or attempt to get it fixed within a few days. Some people are even
reporting a 24 hour turn around. My computer has developed an odd flicker and
because I purchased AppleCare, 2 years later I am still receiving amazing
customer service from the boys and girls at 1 Infinite Loop. These issues can
definitely be classified as "no fun" and the hard freeze issue is a
productivity sponge; however, arm yourself with a video of the issue and go see
an Apple Genius. Moreover, have fun, you spent 2k on a machine that will last a
good long time and dominate most applications during it.
