I have often felt bad about the fact that [this blrrg][3] [highlights][1] the shortcommings of many of its' [own readers][2]. Manily that most of them are illiterate. To clarify and clear the air, I believe many of these people dont know how to read vs can't read. Making jokes about people who can't read is rather bougie and [this blrrg][3] will have none of that.
