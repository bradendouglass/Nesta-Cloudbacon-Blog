This post will be a [quick and dirty][1] rundown of what is banging
around in my head today.

###This Post

A couple [good friends][2] and myself have been working to start up a
coworking location [where we live][3]. Today, there happened to be a
[post][5] make its way to the front page of Hacker news that highlights some
"[issues][4] with coworking locations." I also realized that I have a
twitch when I am focusing really hard. It is a little hard to describe
but, it basically resembles [this][6].

###My Car

I drive sorta fast. Well my wife wouldn't say so but I do. Today I
accidently pegged a divet in the road and [blew a tire][7]. Goodbye 200
dollars. Very sad about this.

###Current Yobs

Yeah, there hadn't been to much talk about this for some time but, a
week ago I was left with the entire techology sector on my plate. Before
I was more of a programmer than a technologist which has changed very
quickly. When a programmer is saddled with help desk and opperations
based work, they tend to have a hard time switching gears. Or maybe I
just have said problem. This definitely of makes me sad.

###My 30 Days Blogging

It has been hard, it is over tomorrow, it was hard, but it was well
worth all of the work. I am sure there will be more of a timeframe
between posts going forward but, I am going to make a conscious effort
to make the quality of said posts a whole lot better than the past
month. Hopefully I didn't drive too many people away.

###Kindles

It appears that [the Verge][8] have gotten their mits on what could be
the new Kindle Fire and e-ink versions. I have been rocking a 2nd
generation Kindle since 09 and definitely like what I am seeing.

###Unedited

It flows better that way...
