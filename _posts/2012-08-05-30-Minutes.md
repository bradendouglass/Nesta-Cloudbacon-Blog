title: 30 Minute Tarcks

If you happen to be an uneducated [peep][1] who doesn't quite grok the
idea of the ["tarck"][2]...well, then I can't help you. However, for the
remainder of this post tarck won't be used in terms of [bikez][3].

Today was the last day of a truly awesome Ruby convention in Pittsburgh
(pronounced "Pittz-burf" by [someone][4] potentially brilliant) dubbed:
Steel City Ruby Conf. Otherwise known as ["SCRC"][5]. Of which I
thought was a motorcycle group, but as always, it is good to be wrong. At
this conference, along with [Greenville][6] [Grok][7] the focus was put
on the 30 minute inbetween sessions.

This meant that although the speaker line up was potentially insane at
SCRC, the organizers put a [large amount of weight][8] on the
human interaction between the talks. I find there to be a few problems
with this model, especially in light of the kind of people who are in
attendance at a <strike>bro</strike>programmer conference...we are mostly awkward OK! So why
force us into a 30 minute "mingle tarcks" with no Internet, little
coffee, and definitely NO beer?

Not [challenging][9] yourself to meet people at conferences is a terrible way
to go through something potentially awesome. However, forcing people
into these (30 minute [tarcks][10]) isn't going to lead to anything
impressive. Yes, a few intermission [tarcks][12] are great. We as nerds should be ripped from
the confort of our [mechanical keyboards][11] and Aeron chairs and
forced to interact with other like minded fools. It is just 100% more
productive when a [lubricant][13] is involved. This could include mini
coding sessions, pairing games for future hackathons, tiny code
challenges, beer drinking, anything!

Keeping these times open and only for 30 minutes makes us realize how
little we can dive into a person's life (if they even let us), before we
are ushered back to another talk. The moral? If you are starting a
conference, think long and hard about the mingle tarcks. They are
_invaluable_; however, if poorly managed, a definite: stagnant
nightmare. Be brilliant and __assist__ in the breeding of said genius.
