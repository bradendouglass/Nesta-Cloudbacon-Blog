When it comes to self improvement, or [improvement overall][1], one of
the hardest things to do is admit that [you might not know
something][2]. Most of the time we couldn't even list, in any order, the
things that "we don't know." Not one. [Suriously][3], try really hard
and use [your power's of awesome][4] to [get a hold][5] of me. For
myself? The hardest part of my software life, and therefore the thing I
have the least amount of experience with is:

> [Mentorship][6]

The experience of having a master to work under and to pester with
questions is invaluable when it comes to walking the road from
an apprentice to a master. There are a few methods (IRC, message boards,
etc) that are acceptable if direct mentorship is not available. However,
these substitutes should not be used without looking for the real deal.

So without further ado, and let's be honest, it is a Sunday, here are
some cool ways to get hooked up with some web programmery based mentors.

1. [Apprentice.io][7]: a Boston based awesome sauce Ruby shop named
   ThoughtBot have a really great thing going on. If you live in the
   North-East or are mobile, this is one of the best programs to check
   out.
1. [HashRocket][8]: Another East coast Ruby company that has a lot of
   cool people behind it. Pretty much the ThoughtBot of Florida.
1. [Hungry Academy][9]: A devision of the folks at Living Social out of
   DC. The program has only had one run but, they hired 100% of the
   developers who went through it.
1. [Code Academy][10]: Chicago based program that focuses on the web
   over specifically Ruby and Rails.
1. [DevBootcamp][11]: This program costs quite a lot at 11,200 but there
   have been some rumblings about the first class seeing salaries hit
   80k

BOOM!
