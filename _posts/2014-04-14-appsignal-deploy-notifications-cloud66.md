title: AppSignal And Cloud66 Deploys
layout: post
---

Peter Berkenbosch wrote an [interesting piece][1] on how to notify [AppSignal][2] that your code has had a successful deploy from [Cloud66][3]. This is a somewhat understated need by the folks at AppSignal. Errors from a deployed application are actually tallied up for each deploy. Meaning if never notified of different or subsequent deploys, AppSignal will shelve everything under 1 deploy. UI wise this is a bit of a shit show.

While Peter’s shell command is nice, it’s a bit verbose and I have had some issues accessing `HEAD` while in the deploy directory. That’s why I built this script:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/braidn/10652341.js"></script>

While it’s a little long (much longer that [80c][4]), it uses Git log which we have easy access to in any Git repo. In no way am I saying that this script trumps Peters; it just happens to be different. Marry this to the `deploy_hooks.yml` example in Peter’s post and you will be quickly alerting AppSignal every time there is a deploy.
