title: Writing Better Specs

Having had the pleasure to get back into Ruby and subsequently the "Rails Stack",
I am now writing a lot more tests. For many people this tends to be a bad thing
but, I find it one of the best ways to write any type of software. In addition,
you sometimes need to explain to a designer why a specific interaction needs to
occur. These guys/gals usually have a "cool story bro" mentality about them and since they
are often awash with color palettes, they sometimes "gloss" over specifics.

This will be a series of [features][1] that are used to explain interactions in
my current work. Ready? Set-GO!

I call it starry, forgotten night.
