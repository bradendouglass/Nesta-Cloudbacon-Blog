title: Leave MacVim To The Noobz
layout: post
---

If it wasn't painfully obvious from my [tweeting][1], I spent the better
half of the first weekend of August, at [a Ruby conference][2]. The one
topic that I was fairly positive would [creep up][3], yet somehow
[magically flew away][4], was the "editor talk." No one was comparing
their Vim configs to people's lowly Textmate installs. No Emacs vs
Sublime Text 2, nothing really. Damn shame.

What did show it's face, was people's love of Sublime Text 2. Wait for the
cmd-tab, wait for it...wait. BOOM! Sublime Text. If it wasn't ST2, then
it was the dreaded MacVim; hater-instiling that you forcibly cmd-tab (that is a [fucking reach][8]) everywhere.
MacVim users probably silently wish that they could cmd-tab through their
legs to [speed up their walking pace][5].

I know [why][6] told us that opinions (he used the word "tastes") would [begin to
define][7] us over what we created; however, I draw the line at being
defined by how many times I can cmd-tab faster than the next person. To
help all of you cmd-tab loving folks (I have fucked my cmd-tab seo on
this post), here is a list of really cool things to get you back into
terminal Vim.

1. Take a look at updating OS X's default version with this [post][9]
1. Being at the terminal level allows you to __NOT__ cmd-tab to it. This
   in itself will speed you up tremendously.
1. Download and use [tmux][10]. It has a learning curve but is well
   worth it for when you start pair programming and as a damn-good
   terminal multiplexer
1. Seriously, download and use tmux. It can be found and installed via
   brew and you can even [buy a book about it][11]
1. If this is your first [rodeo][12], find a great set of defaults,
   either through [Janus][13] or [Yadr][14].
1. Read through what the above config files do, test and try every last
   section
1. Go [here][15], read it all. They are way smarter than I am and always
   have great blog posts on developmenty things.

Give it two weeks. [Close MacVim][16], find a terminal that you can
stand, download tmux and give your new-found freedom a whirl. Then send
me a [message][17] on the Twitters and tell me how it is going.
