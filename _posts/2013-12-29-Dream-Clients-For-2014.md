When you work in ecommerce, especially for a company that focuses on producing great ecommerce experiences, you *dream* of working with certain clients. Perhaps they offer items that you are emotionally attached to, or it's their corporate outlook towards their brand, or perhaps they directly influenced your childhood. Regardless, you constantly critique what they currently offer and pine to open up the web inspector in an attempt to improve your experience. You hyopthesize changes to their checkout flow or even write better and more convincing abandoned cart emails.

For me in 2014, this "dream client" would be [Filson][1]. Sure I grew up in L.L.Bean's back door but, Filson's collection built from tin cloth, wool, and leather materials in combination with their old school, rustic charm make it one of the finest outdoor clothing manufactures. Here's to hoping.
