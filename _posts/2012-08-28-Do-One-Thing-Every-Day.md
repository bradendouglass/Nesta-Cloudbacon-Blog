title: Do One Thing Every Day

[Pants][1], if for some reason you don't know what goes in them.

Life is surprisingly [easy][2], which happens to be contrary to most of
the [jowels out there][3]. What _is_ hard is doing [shit][4]
consistently. Every day to be exact.

The plan was to keep this [post][5] squared away until the very end of
this little test. An experiment to try and write [1 post every day][6]
for the month of August. Posts could be on a myriad of subjects but,
they all had to be > 200 words and posted during the hours of each
day.

It isn't Friday, which happens to the [official][7] end of the month
but, here are some really quick reflections on doing [one thing, every day][8].

1. It's hard. Being able to produce 200 words of prose each day is super
   easy. Making said prose make a lick of sense or even be [remotely][9]
   interesting is pretty fucking hard.
1. Use a product like OmniFocus or [Holly][10] to list out ideas as they
   come by. I did this more at the beginning and got laxed towards the
   end which has been the result of a lot of [lists][11]
1. When you first sit down at a desk everyday, open your daily post and
   work on it throughout the day. Inevitably the post will be better
   than cramming it into 1 hour at night.
1. Build in one cheat day. I didn't do this and I am glad that I didn't.
   However, there will be a time where you are away from a computer and
   have no way to properly construct a post. No one is a failure if they
   miss one day.
1. Make it fun.
1. Teach

Fin.
