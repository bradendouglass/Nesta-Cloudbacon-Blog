Below is a conversation with what I can only guess is a young man over a
current classified item I have up [for sale][1] on the Craigslists.

His original response to the posting:

> Hello! let's do like this, actually now I'm not in town for now, I came to visit my son so i wont be able to meet with you but am okay with the price as seen on the advert, I'll proceed in issuing a Check out to you and when you received the check , I will make arrangement for pick-up. So get back to me with below details asap.
> Name:
> Address:
> City:
> State:
> Postal Code:
> Phone Number:
> And as soon as this is provided, the payment will be overnight to you and i will let you know when its mailed out. I need you to be honest with the sale as I am a God fearing person.
> Thanks
> God Bless.

Needless to say, I felt that a response was required:

> If you were a God fearing person you should know that God eats
> Internet scammers and spammers and shits them out into a very special
> place in Hell.

For one, yes "Internet" is still uppercased, I am not sure what the
folks at the AP are on. And second, I am glad that he/she/it believes
that everyone in the South (sometimes pronounced...with emphasis: "THE
SOUTH") would believe this drivel due to their love. Errrr. Fear of "Gawd". Also, did
I miss something? Why the fuck is the word "Check" capitalized? Maybe
that's their name.
