title: Returns And Deploying Bower/Rails Things
layout: post

---

Recently things have been fairly spartan around here. This isn’t your fault as an [avid reader][1] but, more of time spent upping my skills at what can now only be dubbed [‘computer writing’][2]. Also buying a home, moving, visiting friends and generally being as normal of a person as possible in my shoes might have a little to do with the absence.

Regardless of all that hoopla, there are tentative plans to do a 350 word, 30 day writing sprint coming up soon. All these pro-ported items will be collected right here ([don’t fret][3]). However, here’s a [post that I wrote for people who maybe having a hell-of-a time][6] getting their [Bower][4]-backed Rails applications deployed on [Cloud66][5]. While you are there, I highly recommend reading the other posts… because they are written by folks much smarter than this guy.
