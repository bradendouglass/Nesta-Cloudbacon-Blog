title: Current Workflows
layout: post

OK, rule number one (don't use "[of thumb][2]"), avoid trying to jump
people away from the [meat-and-potatoes][3] of a blog post before they even
start reading. AKA the link in the summary field, did you even click it?
Why not?

Anyway, I hack at my workflows almost constantly. If it isn't reading,
or programming, you can bet that I am looking to do something way [better
than yesterday.][4] Since this post will end up being a [list][6] (hey, they
are super easy to write), most of the workflow will be center around
gui applications and not my overall crack-addiction to a [CLI][5].
Without, further [ado][7], be prepared for [negative-mediocrity][8]!

1. Yes, I run all of my [big ticket][9] applications in Lion and
   Mountain Lion's full screen mode. These are generally Chrome Canary,
   Iterm2, and OmniFocus...sometimes Rdio. This also means that I
   _don't_ use a double monitor setup. I find them distracting and
   overall a [UX clusterfuck][17].
1. I am an [Xmonad][10] freak and wish there was something more like it
   available for the OS X. To get around this I use a launcher named
   [Alfred][11]. Alfred has an extension named [layouts][12] to control
   your windows and I assign cmd + option + # to apps I want to switch
   to quickly. This means that if I want to quickly navigate to Chrome,
   I can hit cmd + option + 2 instead of command-tabing there or using
   the mouse.
1. Vim ([NOT FUCKING MACVIM][13]) + Tmux for [combo][14] awesome-sauce.
   This allows 1 iTerm2 window to stay open in full screen (with only
   two "iTerm" style tabs: tmux + bitlbee/irc server for chatting)
   and act as many different terminals through the power inherent in Tmux. In addition, some people seem to
   have a-beef with Tmux's copy and paste mode...[I don't][15].
1. [Houdini][16] is a free app that will hide away inactive items when a
   certain time limit is hit. The idea being that you have one constant,
   clean workspace. You cmd+tab(I use tab+q because those two items are generally close) to an app that isn't important enough to
   be full screen (thereby taking up a workspace) but, something you want
   to use later. This keeps the one "open" workspace free and
   clear of open/front-facing/distracting apps.

All of this is a little much to take in so if you have any questions hit
me up on the Twitters. Overall though, it works fairly well, the only
thing that I wish for was a smart window tiling manager, ala Xmonad.
[Tyler][18] seems like a good option for this; however, it doesn't seem
to function on Mountain Lion and it is long-in-the-tooth when it comes
to a substantial upgrade...We shall see.
