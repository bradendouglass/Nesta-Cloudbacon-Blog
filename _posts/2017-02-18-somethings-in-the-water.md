This year has started with somewhat of a ! (programmer joke).
Almost like clockework, 
there was plenty of talk [back in December][1] of more writing... 
And here we are almost half way through the second month with nigh a peep. 
This is due to the aforementioned 'bang'.
It involved a plane, some weird feelings, and a whole lot of craziness. 

Suffice it to say though, 
that large things are a-foot. 
Some of these are rather sad, other's good but, 
give it several more months before anything explicit can be written or shared. 
Until then, there are some exciting pieces in the pipeline. 
Namely some about [Typescript][2], 
building communities in places that aren't NYC or San Fran, 
and the complex or sad state of testing large applications.
