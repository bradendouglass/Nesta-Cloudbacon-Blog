title: On Starting New
layout: post

---

Many people have asked me, well...not really asked inasmuch as wondered why I
would simply jump [publishing platforms][1] and start 100% new. Well to you good
sir and doubtfully, mam, this guy has really no idea. It probably has something
to do with a high probability that there is some "aydeeachdee" in them there
genes, or maybe there was some unknown (but now known) monetary ponzie scheme
that I have going on with my one reader. Maybe... one reader? Anyway, the point of
all this is to formally say that there won't be any importing of
[my old material][2]. We started new, and
dammit, we are going to finish new! With that, here is your tech moment
of...catz5.
