And we have reached another proverbial Friday, although mark my
words, I am not counting. I think. First of all, there needs to be a
good amount of explanation concerning the fascination with these "Friday
posts". However, I would like to make an astute observation before I move on. The
keyboard on this 17 MBP is absolute shit.

Anyway, my plan with these Friday rants is to really just try and sum up
a small segment of the week. Whether it be the state of political
affairs like last Friday, or perhaps something crushing about the local
field mouse population. Nothing very heavy, just something that will
make you giggle on a Friday afternoon...when you are probably
drunk and flipping through your RSS reader because you are alone due to
the fact that you know what RSS is. So without further ado, here we go:

It appears that America has finally found itself a suitable and fitting
[past-time][4]: [Zombieism][1]. That's right [another zombie attack][2] was
chronicled this week in yet another, hopeless Southern State. No, go
ahead and take a wild guess. [Yup][3] that's right the great state of
Lousiana and all of it's possible zombie infested inhabitants...welcome
to the danger zone. Best part? Yeah, apparently bath salts, when used
correctly have the potential to throw homeless people into a state of
"excited delirium and dangerous behavior". Frankly, those are two
emotions...or whatever, that I wouldn't want to explore while in a bath
tub. Moral behind all of these attacks? [Be safe, be seen][5].
