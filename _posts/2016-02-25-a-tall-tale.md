I wrote a [Post][1]! Although not on this blrg. Nope, instead Tumblr wooed me over to the dark side and without know where I was or how I had gotten there, a [post][1] had spawned from nowhere. The topic? Remote stuff, mainly work and with a slight twist which includes a hobbit. [Get over there][1] and read it when you find some time. Seriously though. [It's][1] that good.
