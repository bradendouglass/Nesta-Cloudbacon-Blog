There comes a time in [everyone's lives][1], hopefully when they are
young, that they realize [something is wrong][2]. We all go through it
no matter who you are. [Young][3], [old][4], [wealthy][5] or [dirt poor][6].
We all go through a time of reflection that makes us question why and
what we are doing...well, except some of us.

Most people are petrified to question their life choices; however, they do
so because they quickly realize that [everyone else has done it][7].
In addition, I used to be a punk rock fan so I understand about the whole "following
people thing"...and yes there are some times when it is warranted. Some
people call it the [quarter life crisis][8]; however, it is just some
time in your twenties/early thirties where you "[begin to be][9]".

Some of us go through it for longer periods than others and that is ok.
The biggest part being that it occurs. What I have witnessed lately is a
[metric fuck-ton][10] of mid-20 year olds in such a [coddled state][11]
that they completely miss out. Besides raising a bunch of
softy-philosophers (I have no beef with hard ass philosophers), we are
stuck with a group of people who believe...like for fucking real, this
statement:

> all his life he was told that he wanted in life would come to him.

Feel free to sub out "him" with "her" or "[it][12]" in the above sentence.
I recommend taking a firm stance with these people. Read Manga in the
nude, in your living room, talk to yourself loudly at night, save your
urine. Just something to snap them out of their haze.

Fuck, this makes me [sound like one of these guys][13]....
