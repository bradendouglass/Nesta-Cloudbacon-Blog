It's been a while since I wrote really about any fascet of productivity. 
Not because it's taken a backburner or wained over the last few years. 
No, it just seems like it's become a bit of a taboo subject these days. 
However over the last five-ish months, 
there has been an insteresting change in where words are collected. 
More importantly, 
what the boundaries are between the objects that are being written in. 

Here is a fairly exhaustive rundown of the spaces that collect words:

### Wiki

The byline of my rather long running [wiki][wiki] has always been:

> Knowledge Repo

And for good reasons. 
In its' current form, 
some of the oldest commits date back 6 years ago. 
However, this is the last time I changed the way the markdown files were rendered. 
At that time, Gollum, the software that powered and still powers GitHub's wikis was brand new. 
This is when I ported 30-50 some odd pages over to markdown so they could be rendered properly. 
Before that, the wiki lived likely another 3-4 years in RTF form.

This means this is easily, the oldest piece of written knowledge I have laying around. 
Save for some terriblely formatted college papers. 
Much of what's inside now relates to the work that's done every day in software. 
If I am learning a new language, or finding unknowns in a past one, 
all that knowledge winds up in this repository. 
Which means, if you ever are looking to hire me, 
this is a good place to stop before shooting over an email.

### Day One

[Day One][d1] is a beautiful Mac/iOS/Android/Web app that's really focused as a 'journal'. 
This means it's extremely easy to get pictures, social feeds, and more into it. 
In the past I have struggled with whether somethign should be put in here or in the Wiki. 
This changed recently when attempting to highlight and save part of a Medium article. 
There are many moments throughout the day where I read something or 
come across a snippet of text that I want to reflect on later. 

It doesn't make sense to bookmark these 'snippets' because the Medium might go away one day. 
Unless someone was archiving the saved webpage, 
whatever your past self thought interesting, 
might be unatainable by your future self. 
Copy text and adding a link to the original, or 'highlighting the web' has become a big part of what goes into Day One. 
Another great use of this tool is tracking, and managing Goals. 

Goal setting, even once you are an adult, seems so ludicrous. 
We are adults, we should be able to do what we want instead of needing Goals to get there. 
Unfortunatly that's not really the case. 
Goals are really fucking hard to begin with and, 
if you are lacking a means to describe goals, write them down and track them, 
most will slip through the cracks. 
Falling into a world of unfinished and undone dreams. 

Planning goals, monthly 1-on-1's with myself surrounding what was done to nudge closer to the goal, 
and reflections (post mortems) all go into my Goal journal. 
Along with this and the web highlights journal, 
there is one for random photos and a generic one that's a catch all for notes on life, feelings, book's read, etc. 
It took quite a while (maybe 2-3 years) before wrapping my head around the use case of Day One. 
However, it's become an indispensible tool in everyday life. 

Oh yeah. Also the search/tagging/ui/encryption/etc are incredibly polished. 
It might be somewhat expensive to purchase for all platforms but, 
it's worth it for the UI alone.
