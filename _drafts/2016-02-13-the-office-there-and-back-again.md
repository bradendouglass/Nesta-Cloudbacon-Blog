title: The Office There And Back Again
---

Last week remoters of the Dynamo kind decendended on Montreal. 
The hour had come to all pack into several vans and 
head into the wilderness of Quebec for a winter retreat. 
This is always a chance to relax in the mountains, 
drink a few beers, remember if anyone can ski, 
and bond with the team as a whole. 
The bonding experience is a great way to connect, 
reconnect and sometimes disconnect from the whole Dynamo team. 
The only problem that tends to arise out of all this fun, 
is we usually stick around and work a few extra days in the office. 

Normally this wouldn't be much of a issue however, 
many of the remoters don't work in an office on a regular basis. 
We find ourselves held up in our houses, 
sitting at our coworking desks or at random coffee shops stairing at the walls. 
The office, any office can be a buzzing hive of distractions. 
Each one eating away at a remoter's productivity over their time there.

I felt this more than ever over this past trip. 
Struggling to find a space to get into any kind of zone can be a bear for anyone. 
However, if you are unfamiliar to an office (open or cubed) this 
"zone of unproductivity" can become unbearable. 

Over the course of the last 10 months I have actively tried to combat this 
concept by spending small amounts of my week at a local coworking location. 
Like any common office, there are people to grab your attention, 
heat and cooling that is somewhat out of your direct control, 
and a sense of randomness that one can easily squash by controlling your environment. 
Much like the Princes Bride, 
I consumed the above outlined distractions 
hoping that the low dose 
would make the time in Montreal that much easier.  

So far this method fell rather flat.
Not only had I increased my time spent in a coworking location prior to arriving in Montreal but,
there was an active attempt to work in locations that were more 'busy' or distracting. 
All of this in hopes that my time at the office would be one that was in parity, 
productivity wise with my time in my home office. 
Looking back over the week, it wasn't all bad. 

Working closely with peers puts you into a zone that isn't comparible with what you get working alone. 
There is a much closer sense of "oneness" and flow that can be somewhat hard to garnish from reading PR's and Slack. 
In the end, not all was lost; 
however, there must be a way to better prepare one's remote self for the rigors of office life.

If you, the reader, struggles with this,
feel free to leave a comment below or send a tweet to the @dynamomtl Twitter account.
Would love to hear tips, tricks or startegies from folks who have conquored this problem.
