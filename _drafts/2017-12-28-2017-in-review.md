Well all, 
this thing is most certainly in the bag. 
2017... The year that brought us Trump. 
The year Space X figured out how to save a rocket. 
The year a total solar eclipse occured and sadly
a plethora of natural events that terrorized the Carribean, Mexico, Texas and Iran, 
and plenty more fellow humans passed in official terrorist attacks around the globe.

So... not the best year. 
It certainly wasn't the reaper of famous folks that 2016 was, 
nor did it have the summer movie blockbuster set list of 2015. 
However, it's hard to look back on this year and not remark on it's intrigue. 
Its' calm before the shitstorm poise that's been so intoxicating that it might squeeze into yours truly's top 5. 

First of all, and thanks American Airlines, for the most amount of miles flown in a year. 
Sure being strapped into a mostly cardboard tube and hurdled through the air at brake-neck speds isn't for everyone but, 
it's always intrigued me. 
Over the past few years, Laguardia has been a pitstop in a rather simple flight path up to the wonders of Montreal. 
That's Canada if you were unsure. 
However, this year the shoe shine guy at Laguardia actually let me out and even into the city. 

Early on this year, some of the fine folks from Dynamo migrated from the agency lyfe over to the startup world. 
13 of us started working full time at Glossier. 
A beauty and skin care startup located in the heart of Manhattan. 
Having worked at a few of these before, 
there wasn't too much that could have blown a set of socks off. 
This right here, 
this expectation, was one of the few things I bet against incorrectly this year. 
Sadly Bitcoin's meteoric price increase was the other.
