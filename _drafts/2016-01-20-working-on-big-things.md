# Working On Big Things

## The why?

How or what am I trying to accomplish here:

1. Differentiate how writing large software is different than writing small software.
1. Compare and contrast EMGR and HOLR
1. Does it need to be over the top technical?
1. Make clear this isn't a one post foray.

## The technical shit

1. Testing, how HOLR diffs from EMGR
1. Project scope
1. Method lookup, retrieval, finding shit
1. Constraints
