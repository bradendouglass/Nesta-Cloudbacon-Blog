Effectively being a remote employee, 
especially a remote employee who works from home can be one of the toughest jobs ever. 
You are constantly inundated with chores around the house, 
the allure of laundry, Donald Trump youtube impressions, 
and even sometimes work. Shocker the last one.

The one issue with all of these 'tools' 
is they are usually some type of software. 
Weather it is a todo application for your phone, 
a pomodoro timer for your laptop, 
or a helpful web app to manage all of your stories. 

We tend to gravitate towards these types of products 
because they scratch our itch. 
They are software, and when you get down to it,
unless you really truly love software, 
then you likely dislike writing software. 
In addition, we tend to get sucked in by the marketing. 
Some applicationn will save time, just because it has tags!

This is absolutely a fare assessment. 
We work, live, and even breath in a world where software is king. 
It runs our conversations, 
dictates our driving routes, 
and even allows us to read the time! 
Jokes asside, software is, has been and will likely always be eating the world.

Although there is a sense of ubiquity in software, 
that does not mean it is a requirement in the efficacy of our work life. 

In addition, the tools that we use may not need to be of the software kind. 
There exists an entire toolbelt filled with items that can better facilitate 
work, and especially remote work. 
This isn't to say that we should throw away our software tools but, 
let's rely on our own super powers first.

Willpower, and especially willpower depletion is something that everyone hast to deal with. 
However, while in an office, your decisions generally revolve around simple things like: 
food, work and what's going on in your periphary. 
Compared to working at home or even in a shared space, 
the choices you are required to make in the office are minimal at best. 
The more choices that someone is forced to make, 
the more willpower that will be deleted and at an accelerated rate. 
When willpower is low, our minds tend to default to solving the easiest problems
