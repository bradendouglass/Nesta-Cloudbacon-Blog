Over the last week, 4 folks from Dynamo went off to Pitsburgh PA 
and attended [Abstractions][1]. The conference was sold as 
an intersection between everyone involved in building the modern web. 
Since this space is quite near-and-dear to our Dynamo hearts, 
we thought it would be a great place to see where the web is headed.

Overall, this was a massive conference, 
with 4 days of speakers,from 9am to 8pm,
spanning 4 different disceplines there was never a shortage of talks 
and often very little time to grab a bite to eat. 
After listening to over 20 talks spanning all 4 days, 
there were some very clear takeaways from the folks who are building and designing the current web.

### _Takeaway #1_: Functional Programming is Not A Fad (yet)

If you are looking for a conference that get's down and dirty on code, 
[ala Codemash][2], Abstractions might not have been a great choice. 
The schedule was sparse overall with languages specifically. 
However the talks that were about a language, 
were predominatly those of the [functional nature][3]. 
The top three being [Elixir][4], 
[Elm][5], and everyone's favorite: Javascript.
Although, if you are a fan of objects, 
the wonderful [Sandi Metz][6] was there with a great talk on code smells.

It would appear that the functional world of programming, 
once jailed to the world of acadamia has made a triumphant escape. 
Folks seemed generaly interested and chatty about Elm's architecture, 
the concurrent power behind Elixir, 
and the ease of programming that comes from a bag of functions versus one of classes. 
Being somewhat impressed by the ecosystem surrounding Elm and functional/reactive programming, 
there is definitely a realm for this in today's world of muddied class names, 
and object responsibility juggling.

Many of the rest of the programming talks focused on the history of programming. 
Where we have come, 
especially concerned with the Javascript ecosystem, 
and where things might go in the future. 
These 'softer talks' were much more lightweight 
and were a good break from the much more technical, language specific talks

###_Takeaway #2_: Feelings Are A Valid Feeling

Speaking of the softer side of programming, 
many talks touched on the term: 'happiness.' 
Especially, focusing on how to better find 'all the happiness' in the
