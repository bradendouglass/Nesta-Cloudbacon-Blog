title: Abstractions Conference State Of The Web
tags: 'conference, recap, programming, dynamo'
---

Over the last week, 4 folks from Dynamo went off to Pitsburgh PA 
and attended [Abstractions][1]. The conference was sold as 
an intersection between everyone involved in building the modern web. 
Since this space is quite near-and-dear to our Dynamo hearts, 
we thought it would be a great place to see where the web is headed in 2016 and beyond.

Overall, this was a massive conference, 
with 4 days of speakers, from 9am to 8pm,
and spanning 4 different disceplines. 
There was never a shortage of talks 
and often very little time to grab a bite to eat during the down times. 
After listening to over 20 talks spanning all 4 days, 
there were some very clear takeaways from the folks who are building and designing the current web.

### _Takeaway #1_: Functional Programming is Not A Fad (yet)

If you are looking for a conference that get's down and dirty on code, 
[ala Codemash][2], Abstractions might not have been a great choice. 
The schedule was sparse overall with languages specifically. 
However the talks that were about a language, 
were predominatly those of the [functional nature][3]. 
The top three being [Elixir][4], 
[Elm][5], and everyone's favorite: Javascript.
Although, if you are a fan of objects, 
the wonderful [Sandi Metz][6] was there with a great talk on code smells.

It would appear that the functional world of programming, 
once jailed to the world of acadamia has made a triumphant escape. 
Folks seemed generaly interested and chatty about Elm's architecture, 
the concurrent power behind Elixir, 
and the ease of programming that comes from a bag of functions versus one of classes. 
Being somewhat impressed by the ecosystem surrounding Elm and functional/reactive programming, 
there is definitely space for this in today's world of muddied class names, 
and object responsibility juggling.

Many of the rest of the programming talks focused on the history of programming. 
Where we have come, 
especially concerned with the Javascript ecosystem, 
and where things might go in the future. 
These 'softer talks' were much more lightweight 
and were a good break from the much more technical, language specific presentations.

###_Takeaway #2_: Feelings Are A Valid Feeling

Speaking of the softer side of programming, 
many talks touched on the term: 'happiness.' 
Especially, focusing on how to better find 'all the happiness' in programming. 
A lot of these happiness focused around API's which is [has been a focus at Dynamo for some time.][7]
While others focused on the mental health side 
that sometimes takes a backburner in web development and design. 

Regardless of what part of the web you build, 
happiness and health should be top of mind. 
However, these softer talks so rarely get added to conference schedules. 
This omission leads people in the industry to 
talk about these intensly important subjects only in backchannels 
or in small group settings. 
Talking about this in smaller settings often give relief but, can lead to invalidation. 
Opening so many talks up to these concepts during Abstractions 
really legitimized that we as group of people need to take happiness and health seriously.

As an active speaker / want to be active speaker in the community, 
there are many 'call for papers' proposals active right now for conferences in 2017. 
If you, feel as strongly as the folks at Abstractions about this subject, 
I highly encourage submitting a talk. 
The worst thing that could happen is conference organizers shoot your proposal down. 

###_Takeaway #3_: Containerization Is The Way Forward 

Containers, the [Docker kind][8] are still quite hot. 
Granted several of the sponsors for Abstractions were companies 
that profit on this technology. 
However, there was a still a good amount of chatter in the halls around this concept. 

Devops is super hard and doubly so with a distributed application architecture. 
The hope of build once, and run anywhere is still top of mind for engineers. 
After listening to a few talks, 
it's abundantly clear that there are many players in the container space.
The struggle is real when striving to deploy a swath of mini applications, 
that all talk together and rely on one another. 
However, it's one of those technologies that has yet to shake itself out completely. 
From a builder's standpoint this is a little crazy. 
I am not interested in deploying an app to production and have the management layer/company disolve days later.

###_Takeaway #4_: There are Some Fun Talks On Their Way

Many of the talks that all of us heard throughout Abstractions, 
I have yet to hear on [Confreaks.tv][9] or Youtube. 
There is likely a very good reason for this: 

Many circuit speakers will introduce new and experimental talks at these 'smaller conferences.' 
Afterwards, they will judge how well it went, 
what was the pulse of the audience, 
and especially what did the other speakers think. 
They will then tweak what's needed and then resubmit the talk to bigger,
more 'renouned' conferences. 

All 23 (besides 1 actually) talks that I attended were very well thought out and 
would draw just as much of a crowd at any other conference. 

###_Takeaway #5_: There is Plenty Of Space For The Generalist

Larger scale (Abstractions had 6 tracks) generalist conferences, 
the ones that don't specifically focus on a single topic ([Railsconf][10]). 
[Another large, generalist conference name AllThingsOpen][11] has been going on now for several years.
The first couple of years were rocky but, the last few years have atracted a phenominal amount of great speakers. 
These larger scale conferences likely take several years to get the 'hang of things'. 
This was the first year of Abstractions and with all the technology happening around Pittsburgh, 
it has plenty of room to grow.
